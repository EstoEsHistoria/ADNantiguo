<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">As the chapters in this volume have shown, the study of ancient DNA is providing a rich new strand of evidence for understanding the Neolithic period in Europe. Large-scale studies of populations and migrations are now being supplemented by much finer-grained research into genetic relations between people. Alongside the many grounds for admiration and optimism, there are nevertheless reasons for measured caution. This chapter will explore the sometimes problematic way in which genetic ancestry has been interpreted using long-discredited notions of social organisation, hierarchy, ethnicity and kinship. It will argue for a ‘slow science’ approach to collaborative ancient DNA (aDNA) research that makes room for nuanced and reflexive interpretation drawing on the humanities, particularly anthropological and archaeological theory. Genetic change and relatedness need to be considered in the light of the partial nature of the archaeological record and the samples available to researchers, couched using careful terminologies, interpreted alongside other strands of archaeological and anthropological evidence and grounded in critical approaches to social identity and kinship. Some suggestions are made looking forward to a time when aDNA research is fully embedded within archaeological interpretations of the period, and archaeological thinking firmly within interpretations of genetic data.</span></p>
<p class="h">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="noindent">About 20 years ago, when I was an undergraduate archaeology student, I found myself talking about ancient DNA while sitting in the garden of my aunt’s house in Oxford. I was being interrogated by my cousin’s father Bryan Sykes (not my uncle – kinship is complex!) on the major questions in archaeology that the study of aDNA could help answer. The immediate and only response that sprang to my mind was biological relatedness: wouldn’t it be wonderful to know whether people buried together in Neolithic tombs such as West Kennet long barrow were related to each other? It might help us understand how social groups were organised and who was chosen for burial in such spectacular monuments. At the time I had no concept that genetics could answer questions about mass population movements, major subsistence and technological transitions, or the spread of languages. During the conference in November 2021, I finally saw what had been in my mind that day – a family tree setting out how the burials from Hazleton North long barrow in Gloucestershire were likely to have been biologically related: genealogy from 4700 years ago (Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_184"></a>Since then, my research interests have developed to focus on the landscapes and monuments of the middle and late Neolithic period in Britain and Ireland as well as the Neolithic to Early Bronze Age transition. From this limited archaeological perspective, with no specialist knowledge of genetics, this chapter will explore three subject areas that are central to the interpretation of human aDNA: biological relatedness, social organisation and uneven patterns in funerary practices. It is worth exploring these in some detail, as a deeper and more critical understanding of them may help to influence how aDNA results are interpreted. In the fast-paced world of publication in major science journals and the desire for sensational results, there is an argument to be made for a more considered, slower and more collaborative approach that takes some of these interpretative issues on board; some suggestions towards how we might achieve this are made at the end of the chapter.</p>
<p class="h">LOOKING BACK: DANCE OF THE DISCIPLINES</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the development of second or next generation short-read sequencing technologies and the recognition of petrous bones as sources of well-preserved DNA, alongside other methodological improvements (see Ariano and Bradley, this volume), the last seven years have seen an increasing deluge of archaeogenetic papers and new data. Initial high-profile research projects focused on mass population movements and the spread of languages (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Allentoft <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015; Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015). These large-scale narrative interpretations were at a scale beyond which most archaeologists felt confident to operate. The return to outdated cultural-historical models and the revival of migration as the only explanation for change were disruptive and unsettling. They exposed unresolved problems within archaeology relating to the definition of material culture groups and how these might relate to identity and social organisation, and highlighted a lack of theorisation relating to migration and acculturation.</p>
<p class="indent">There are now well-rehearsed criticisms relating to assumptions within these early papers about archaeological cultures being distinct populations or social groups (Vander Linden 2016; Furholt 2018, 162) and for the way in which interpretations extended well beyond the genetic data (Kristiansen 2022, 11; this volume). It has become clearer to researchers working in both palaeogenetics and archaeology that each discipline uses models to describe and communicate their ideas and findings (Booth 2019, 591). Genetic scientists identify groups of individuals who share more genetic variants with each other than with individuals outside these groups, giving them names such as ‘Western hunter-gatherer’. Archaeologists traditionally identify groups of individuals who share more cultural traits with each other than with individuals outside these groups, giving them labels such as ‘Corded Ware Culture’. Both types of terminology simply express similarity, but they are imprecise and can be misleading if they are taken to mean bounded population groups or are used interchangeably. This can lead to a blurring of the distinction between genetic variants and cultural traits, even though these are entirely unrelated types of evidence (Frieman and Hofmann 2019). Despite alternative solutions for more neutral nomenclature proposed by Eisenmann <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2018), it seems that mixed geographical and cultural labels continue to <a id="page_185"></a>be preferred within archaeogenetics, despite a shift to more neutral variations (Kristiansen, this volume). This seemingly intractable problem means that each paper needs to set out why these labels have been chosen, with an awareness of the potential impact of their use on wider understandings. Similar attentiveness needs to be paid within archaeological publications too; for example, within a British context, the neutral terms ‘Beaker-using people’ or ‘Beaker-associated burials’ are far preferable to ‘Beaker people’.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the reasons that the arrival of aDNA papers enshrining a return to ‘culture-historical’ models of population change felt so unsettling for archaeologists is because this approach was so far divorced from current interpretative strands within western European and American archaeology. Building on decades of feminist and post-processual thinking that firmly rejects socio-evolutionary labels like ‘chiefdom’ and the use of archaeological ‘cultures’ altogether, some archaeologists are actively exploring entirely different ideas relating to materiality, relationality, assemblage theory and non-human actors (Harris and Cipolla 2017). However, by avoiding migration and large-scale movement as a topic, archaeologists have neglected to develop sophisticated theories relating to how different communities segregate, integrate and negotiate their cultural differences to form new identities. This work must now take place as a matter of urgency, enlightened by the wide array of available anthropological evidence.</p>
<p class="h">FAMILY TIES</p>
<p class="noindent">The ‘ontological turn’ in archaeology has led to a reframing of ideas relating to kinship, gender practices and more lately, power relations – fields to which aDNA researchers are now contributing fundamental new data and about which they are reaching their own conclusions, albeit from a radically different theoretical perspective (Crellin and Harris 2020). As the papers in this volume show, archaeogenetics is now maturing as a discipline, with a shift to smaller-scale questions and a greater understanding of the complexity of cultural change in the past (Kristiansen 2022, 14). Finer-grained studies are teasing out the detail of how migration and integration took place. Collaborative research projects have begun to combine genetics with other bioarchaeological sciences such as isotope analysis, and sometimes with archaeological analysis of, for example, grave goods (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Mittnik <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019). A series of recent aDNA papers have been able to reconstruct patterns of biological relatedness, either within single cemeteries or burial monuments (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Mittnik <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Sjögren <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020) or across more dispersed sites (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Despite some of these aDNA papers having extended discussions incorporating insights from anthropology (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Sjögren <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020), many of the interpretations apply idealised models of kinship that are somewhat crude and outdated, without sufficient understanding of archaeological context, or of the current debates and nuances surrounding these topics (Frieman <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Brück and Frieman 2021; Ensor 2021). For example, authors commonly refer to ‘marriage’ as shorthand for ‘had children with’, unconsciously applying modern Eurocentric notions of heterosexual monogamous long-term partnerships, which may not have been practised in the past. In response, Brück (2021) has set out a range of ethnographic examples to show how <a id="page_186"></a>kinship need not be a direct reflection of genetic links, and Booth <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2021) have set a high standard in their analysis of genetic data, deftly undermining and questioning common assumptions about kinship relations, migration, patrilineality and exogamy, using pertinent anthropological examples. These are needed to help to address the lack of creativity and imagination in interpretations about how people in the past lived, moving beyond ‘common-sense’ (Eurocentric and modern) assumptions. As Frieman (2021) has highlighted, aDNA results can privilege the biological aspect of kinship relations, which may be far more relevant to us as modern scholars than it was to people in the past.</p>
<p class="indent">That said, Fowler and colleagues (2022) offer a counterexample of a collaboration between geneticists and archaeologists with a good understanding of post-modern and relational approaches, helped by strong archaeological peer review and further interpretation (Fowler 2022). Analysis of genetic data from individuals buried within the early Neolithic long barrow at Hazleton North in Gloucestershire has allowed the reconstruction of the biological relations of an extended lineage over five generations (Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). This lineage was descended from one male and four females with whom he had children, with the social architecture of the tomb, that is the location of the burials within the two chambers, almost entirely based on maternal lines of descent. The people interred were mostly sons and grandsons (adult daughters do not seem to have been placed within this tomb), but these included sons of the female partners by other males. The authors suggest that this indicates adoptive kinship or social fatherhood, using the term stepfather (Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022, 586), although the evidence could equally suggest that descent from the maternal line for these individuals was more important. The evidence suggests that different aspects of both paternal and maternal descent were important markers of identity negotiated through choices made during the construction of the tomb and ongoing funerary practices (Fowler 2022). Interestingly, eight of the sampled individuals buried within the tomb were not biologically related to the main family, but may well have been considered close kin, at least within the context of the funerary sphere. This serves to emphasise how aDNA results can bring useful evidence about non-biological forms of kinship, with adoption, co-residence or other forms of social relationship potentially being of equal importance and expressed through the placement of the dead.</p>
<p class="indent">As others (Frieman <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Brück 2021) have argued, implicit gender bias appears to often influence interpretations in aDNA studies. It is easy to slip from a description of communities as patrilineal and patrilocal, to stating that they were patriarchal. Simply because males and their male descendants stay in the same location does not necessarily mean that these communities were controlled by men. As Brück (2021, 232) has identified, Sjögren <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020) describe the people buried in Beaker-using community cemeteries in southern Germany as patriarchal. They write of ‘a dominant male line that married in women from other groups and married out their own daughters’ (Sjögren <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020, 23). Women have become pawns in a game of male alliances, rather than people with agency, who were valued for reasons other than simply reproduction, with extensive knowledge of other places and communities. If these were travelling males, they would have been characterised as explorers or pioneers. The paper’s application of a binary model of sex (Frieman <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019) leads to conclusions that gloss over two burials <a id="page_187"></a>where gender-differentiated burial practices were not followed, and isotopic evidence that shows that some males also travelled to other places during their lifetimes.</p>
<p class="h">IDENTIFYING INEQUALITY</p>
<p class="noindent">It is worth underlining that decisions relating to funerary practices, burial processes and the placement of the dead, as well as possible subsequent removal and disturbance of burials, were ongoing performances, actively creating and negotiating identity and community among the living (Parker Pearson 1999). People may well have been brought together in death who did not live together in life. In some aDNA papers, there is a tendency to assume that grave goods can reflect the status of the deceased in life, but as archaeologists are taught, ‘the dead don’t bury themselves’. The aDNA evidence from a Bronze Age cemetery in the Lech river valley in southern Germany showed that ‘richer’ grave goods were buried more often with men who had relatives in that or nearby cemeteries, leading to the suggestion that these men were of higher status (Mittnik <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019, 732). Perhaps instead this was because they had more family members in the vicinity to contribute to the funeral, rather than necessarily reflecting their status or position in life.</p>
<p class="indent">The identification of distant biological relatedness among individuals buried within geographically dispersed and diverse passage tombs in Neolithic Ireland (such as Carrowmore, Millin Bay, Newgrange and Carrowkeel), as well as distinct genetic clustering of sampled individuals buried in these tombs, has led to the conclusion that these people identified themselves by descent, chose partners from within their circle of relatives, and that, therefore, society at this time had a high degree of social complexity, in short, constituting a ‘dynastic elite’ (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020, 386). However, this genetic information needs to be analysed carefully in combination with modelled radiocarbon dates for these individuals. The distantly related individuals have dates that show that they are unlikely to have lived contemporaneously but instead were spread out over <span class="italic">c</span>. 1000 years of the Neolithic. The individuals interred at Carrowkeel date from the latest Neolithic and were interred in these tombs well after their main use for the deposition of cremations. Is it possible that one elite extended family controlled these tombs, and retained the exclusive right for burial within them over such a long period, as claimed (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; this volume)? The idea is contradicted by aDNA results from six individuals within Carrowkeel Cairn K who did not show any biological kinship closer than 4th-degree relatives (Kador <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018, 23).</p>
<p class="indent">Assessing the uniqueness of burials within these passage tombs is difficult due to the fact there are few comparable aDNA samples from non-passage tomb contexts from the middle and later Neolithic period in Ireland, largely because of the archaeologically invisible ways in which most people were treated after death (see below). Could the genetic clustering identified by Cassidy and colleagues simply be an outcome of temporal drift instead, suggesting an increasingly limited island population with little out-breeding in the second half of the Neolithic? The fact that some individuals were distant biological relations of each other may have been a relatively meaningless factor in the creation of their identities. Until more data are available, there is nothing conclusive in the evidence <a id="page_188"></a>so far to suggest social hierarchy or elite families being buried in these passage tombs. Although the presence of large monuments is often used to assume social hierarchy, this is not a given; there are several societies around the world where communal monuments were built without evidence for strong social inequalities.</p>
<p class="indent">The discovery of an individual whose unburnt skull was deposited in the chamber at Newgrange passage tomb, who was the offspring of a first-order incestuous union, has been interpreted as a behaviour indicative of a ruling elite family of a complex chiefdom or early state (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Abstracting from one individual (whose genetic status may or may not have been known to his contemporaries, or to those who placed his remains in the tomb) to a whole structure of society is problematic, and this is only one of several possible different interpretations for the status of this person. One example cannot determine whether incest was widely practised within a community, nor whether it was deemed socially acceptable or not. Even if this was a practice related to preserving an elite lineage, it may have been very short-lived or even a one-off phenomenon, rather than indicative of the wider trajectory of social evolution. For this reason, terms such as chiefdom or early state need to be avoided, as these form part of long-discredited socio-evolutionary models. Many societies are known that do not fit these categories (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Clastres 1977), documented examples of chiefdoms and early states have been shown to often be secondary formations that are reflections of modern world systems (Chapman 2003), and the Pacific Island societies that were the original models for many of these socio-evolutionary models have been shown to have widely varied forms of social organisation and expressions of monumentality (Bedford 2019). Interestingly, a recent aDNA study on Neolithic human remains from the Xagħra Circle on Gozo, Malta, did not reach conclusions relating to inequality or social hierarchy, despite identifying close inbreeding among their ancestry (Ariano <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">Interpretations of aDNA evidence relating to social hierarchy and status in the absence of other archaeological evidence need to be cautiously applied, and different possibilities considered. There are, of course, widely varying opinions on this topic within the archaeological community (compare Sheridan 2020 with Carlin 2020, for example); aDNA is one strand of evidence to add to these ongoing debates. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for aDNA papers to simply cite the interpretations of previous genetic studies. For example, Dulias <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2022) cite Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020) to support their conclusion that strong hierarchies existed among megalithic communities across Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p class="h">THE MISSING DEAD</p>
<p class="noindent">For much of the Neolithic in Britain and Ireland, people disposed of their dead in archaeologically invisible ways. Where burials have survived, for example within early Neolithic long barrows or middle Neolithic passage tombs, only a small selection of the community appear to have been selected for interment, and aside from this selection, there are very few indicators of status or social hierarchy. Cremation appears to have been the preferred (although by no means exclusive) funerary practice during the middle Neolithic (Willis 2021), with limited numbers of cremations deposited within small and <a id="page_189"></a>large circular enclosures in the years around 3000 cal BC (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> at Stonehenge, West Stow and Dorchester-on-Thames). By the late Neolithic, the dead are almost entirely invisible within the archaeological record. It has been suggested that people were depositing cremations in rivers or the sea (Parker Pearson 2020, 497) and this seems likely, but direct evidence remains very sparse. As it is not currently possible to extract aDNA from burnt bones, despite laudable attempts to do so (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020, supp. info., 21), a large part of the Neolithic therefore currently lies beyond the reach of genetic analysis. New types of individual burial accompanied with grave goods and in particular Beaker pottery begin in the Chalcolithic period after 2450 cal BC or so, which have been clearly shown through aDNA analysis to reflect new people moving into Britain and Ireland from the Continent (Olalde <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018). However, there remains variability in funerary rites, with the practice of cremation likely continuing among both local communities and brought in as an existing practice by incomers, as well as disarticulation and mixed burials (Bloxam and Parker Pearson 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">It is against this extremely partial picture of funerary practices that aDNA results must be understood. The paper on Hazleton North neglects to mention the presence of over 200 fragments of cremated human bone within the chambers of this tomb, largely found within the entrance to the northern chamber, where the cremated remains of at least one adult (and likely more) and one child were scattered (Saville 1990, 104, table 50). Similarly, Dulias <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2022) note their inability to assess cremated remains from the Bronze Age cemetery on Westray, Orkney. Although genetic information from these individuals might not drastically alter the overall picture obtained from the unburnt remains, perhaps particular people from separate lineages or other types of kin were interred in this way. Within Irish passage tombs, considerable quantities of intermingled burnt and unburnt human remains are usually found within the chambers, but aDNA can only be extracted from the smaller amounts of unburnt bone. In addition, selecting the petrous bone from the skull, a part often treated differently from the rest of the skeleton, introduces further bias; these unburnt skulls might represent a particular subset of the community (Charlton <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">As Booth <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2021) have demonstrated, the major shift in genetic ancestry at the start of the Chalcolithic identified by Olalde <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2018) was not a sudden population replacement, but a more gradual transition over 10–16 generations. Certain individuals up to around 2000 cal BC have significant proportions of ‘Neolithic’ ancestry showing the persistence of unsampled populations who only infrequently had children with the new arrivals and their descendants, and who chose to bury their dead in archaeologically invisible ways (Booth <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021, 381). Slightly later, by around 2100 cal BC onwards, there is more integration visible in the genetics, a pattern that must be interpreted alongside changes evident in the archaeological record around this time, including the development of new pottery styles and decoration, increasing use of bronze and changing funerary practices, such as more frequent cremation burials and a marked diversification in grave groups (Needham 2005; Carlin 2020). The existence of such parallel populations, sharing places of residence, landscapes, technologies, fashions and perhaps language for lengthy periods, but not regularly intermixing genetically, can now be seen in various places and times across Europe, as finer-grained aDNA evidence becomes available that more closely matches the complexity visible in the archaeological record (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Furtwängler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Papac <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021; Bánffy, this volume).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_190"></a>More detailed chronologies for late Neolithic monument building, alteration, use and abandonment will help with understanding the impact of new arrivals in Britain, and the social contexts within which interactions took place (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Greaney <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Although major monument construction in southern Britain appears to cease after <span class="italic">c</span>. 2400 cal BC (the date varies regionally), many of these sites retained their significance, with deposition at these sites continuing, Beaker-associated burials placed nearby, and some, such as Stonehenge, being remodelled. The mapping out of these processes of division and difference, integration and affiliation, and how these contributed to identity building in different regions, is a task that the archaeological community is best placed to undertake. Genetic data form one strand of evidence to be used in these debates, alongside other sources such as isotope and dietary information, radiocarbon dates, material culture and changes in the environment and wider landscapes.</p>
<p class="h">LOOKING FORWARD: TOWARDS THE TRANSDISCIPLINARY</p>
<p class="noindent">The world of archaeogenetics is exciting and fast-developing. We are learning things about the Neolithic that would astonish archaeologists working in this area only 20 years ago. There is already much to digest, to integrate and to re-assess in the light of these new results (see Bánffy this volume). But what other research questions might we want to address in future? From the perspective of Neolithic Britain and Ireland, we now have data from chambered tombs in Ireland and one from the Cotswolds that show very different patterns of biological relatedness (Fowler 2022, 73). How might these compare with people buried in early Neolithic tombs in Caithness, or Kent? A focus on mass population movements at the beginning and end of the Neolithic means that middle Neolithic burials have been neglected so far in aDNA analyses, but these could provide information about biological relatedness, movement, social relations, disease and demography. Were the four children buried with elaborately carved chalk drums in Yorkshire in the middle Neolithic related to each other? What about the middle Neolithic ‘mass grave’ at Banbury Lane, Northamptonshire, or the burials at Duggleby Howe, East Yorkshire?</p>
<p class="indent">Looking ahead, how can we ensure that these research questions are answered within truly collaborative, transdisciplinary work between archaeogenetists and archaeologists? Frieman and Hofmann (2019) have identified steps that can be taken, for example suggesting that aDNA labs encourage more discursive and lengthy publications in collaboration with archaeologists and arguing for ontological reflection at each stage of research projects. Richardson and Booth (2017) have highlighted the need to develop venues and mechanisms for the two disciplines to come into contact more often: one of the aims of the NSG conference. In this volume, Kristiansen has set out some of the key steps and issues involved in the move towards truly transdisciplinary work.</p>
<p class="indent">Meaningful, cross-disciplinary collaboration should create further best-practice models to follow, with research questions formulated, as well as results interpreted, in light of current archaeological and anthropological thinking on gender, kinship, identity, power and social inequality, as well as new thinking on migration and acculturation. Going further, I would argue that there is a need for archaeologists and geneticists to make steps together <a id="page_191"></a>towards a ‘slow science’ approach (Stengers 2018; see Caraher 2019 for a discussion of ‘slow archaeology’), shifting the value of such work from a focus entirely on research outputs towards research that benefits the general public. It involves giving time and energy to the sharing of information through workshops and discussion groups, where each discipline learns about the methods and theories of the other, rather than simply publishing across each other’s bows. It should involve embedding archaeologically trained researchers into aDNA laboratories or projects and the discussion of ethical implications, from sampling decisions to interpretation. One proactive way forward would be to set up a short course on archaeogenetics so that archaeologists can engage more confidently with a basic understanding of the science behind this complex field; conversely, a course on social archaeology may help geneticists working on the archaeological material acquire the same confidence. ‘Slow science’ is time-consuming and hard work, particularly as it goes against major structural constraints of funding, traditional career progression models, competition for the ‘big story’ and high-impact publication strategies (Sykes <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). An edited volume such as this falls far short in terms of academic impact models (we therefore extend huge thanks to all the authors for contributing); perhaps we need to re-assess whether all impact is good impact. These are major issues for academia that stretch far beyond the limits of our own disciplines and are common to wider inter-disciplinary research.</p>
<p class="indent">Why is it important to build further collaborative projects and move towards a more nuanced ‘slow science’? First, it is needed in order to do justice to the complexities and realities of the past, without perpetuating unconscious assumptions or biases. The second reason is preventative – we have seen how initial large-scale aDNA studies over-simplified processes of migration resulting in misleading conclusions. As genetic studies become more fine-grained, interpretations might well contain assumptions about kinship, gender and social hierarchy. It is perhaps possible to predict the areas of disagreement that might come next: further assumptions about gender without reference to queer theory perhaps (Frieman <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Bickle 2020), or the difficulties of equating population estimates with contradictory archaeological evidence. If we can work together more collaboratively, we may be able to break the cycle of ‘big story’ followed by critique and counter-narrative. Finally, we know that the great press interest and impact of palaeogenetics papers on the wider public can result in over-simplification and unhelpful public discourse (Richardson and Booth 2017; Frieman and Hofmann 2019; Hakenbeck 2019), often giving the impression that genetic evidence can solve all archaeological questions (Jones and Bösl 2021). Although archaeologists and geneticists have no control over how the media report on their discoveries, we do have considerable influence over the choice of paper titles, university or institution press releases and quotes given to journalists. It is possible to predict the likely press angles and possible controversies, and these should be predicted and mitigated against to prevent interpretative inflation (Barclay and Brophy 2020). It is also important not to perpetuate out-dated approaches to the past that make inequality seem inevitable (Graeber and Wengrow 2021). Relying on long-dismissed evolutionary social models and minimising the complexity of human behaviour limits our interpretation of the past, making extreme social inequality and contemporary stereotypes seem natural and inevitable, both in the past and today. These are fundamental issues for how we reconstruct the lives of people in the past, and how we tell stories about our own future.</p>
