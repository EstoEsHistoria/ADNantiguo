<p class="chaptitle">Five challenges for an integrated archaeogenetic paradigm</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch3-1"><span class="italic1">Kristian Kristiansen</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">The increasing pace of ancient DNA research, especially since 2015, can be seen as part of the third science revolution in archaeology. I outline what I see as the five current principal challenges, covering sampling and collaborative ethics, in the hope of creating shared codes of conduct; definitions of terminology and context, to avoid cross-disciplinary misunderstandings; open access to all forms of big data; a need to shift from interdisciplinarity to transdisciplinarity; and the integration of the interpretation of genes and culture, to investigate respective admixture processes and to translate biological mating processes into rules of kinship and marriage. The study of environmental DNA (eDNA) is seen as part of the next steps forward, representing the second phase of the third science revolution in archaeology.</span></p>
<p class="h">BACKGROUND: 10 YEARS AFTER THE THIRD SCIENCE REVOLUTION</p>
<p class="noindent">The third science revolution in archaeology has now been ongoing for little more than 10 years, since the first human prehistoric genomes were published in 2010. However, it is only from about 2015 that developments in both sequencing capacity and an increasing number of prehistoric samples being analysed created a real breakthrough in our understanding of genetic results for European prehistory. This has been summarised in several popular syntheses (Reich 2018; Krause 2019), and raised critical debates over the implications of the new genetic results, and how to integrate them into an archaeological context (Kristiansen 2022). From that arises the prospect of a more integrated archaeogenetic approach based on a truly interdisciplinary or even a transdisciplinary integration between the two disciplines. However, to get there we need to be aware of some of the challenges ahead. Here I discuss what I consider to be the five major challenges, some well recognised, others less so.</p>
<p class="h">TOWARD AN INTEGRATED ARCHAEOGENETIC PARADIGM</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="italic">1. Sampling and collaborative ethics</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This topic has risen to become a key issue, with papers discussing the demands that need to be fulfilled (Prendergast and Sawchuk 2018; Sirak and Sedig 2019; Alpaslan-Roodenberg 2021). How do we create a truly integrated collaborative sampling and project design, where <a id="page_32"></a>sampling is done to support clearly formulated research questions, and where collaboration is real? The immediate answer of course is to invite all relevant disciplines on board when starting a new project, including sample providers. This latter group is highly diverse, and we encounter huge differences in different parts of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">To begin with we need to realise that archaeology is a discipline of destruction and selective preservation. Excavation means destroying the object of study, and in the process documenting as much as possible. Therefore, the history of archaeology has seen the establishment of written and unwritten rules of how to preserve through destruction; among the unwritten rules are the constant refinement of methods of documentation – from actual excavation methods to the preservation of documentation in archives, and objects in museums. Among the written rules are the legal frameworks that regulate the preservation of sites and monuments in the landscape, economic obligations to pay for rescue excavations when destruction is inevitable, and the legal framework for the operation of museums to store and present archaeological evidence for researchers and the public (Kristiansen 2009). Access to archaeological material for research also has a destructive side if one needs to sample objects for further scientific analysis, and this has been an ongoing practice since the beginnings of archaeology. However, with the advent of new scientific breakthroughs or revolutions in archaeology (Kristiansen 2014), the frequency of such sampling has multiplied: from pottery to metals in order to undertake various forms of isotope and lipid analyses; from animal, plant and human material to sample for radiocarbon dating; and various forms of strontium analyses.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the years codes of conduct, often unpublished, have been established for how and under which conditions sampling is allowed, just as protocols have been established, most clearly for sampling for radiocarbon dating, where only small samples are now needed (Sirak and Sedig 2019). However, the most recent scientific revolution, that of ancient DNA (hereafter aDNA) or palaeogenomics and archaeogenetics, has not yet seen the formulation of shared codes of conduct for collaboration between the archaeological and the scientific community, even if needs and principles have been demonstrated and discussed (Prendergast and Sawchuk 2018; Sirak and Sedig 2019) that can form the basis for future codes of conduct, preferably by archaeological societies such as EAA and SAA (Alpaslan-Roodenberg 2021). The highest quality aDNA research on archaeological samples is typically found when geneticists, curators of anthropological collections and archaeologists engage each other in close and equitable research collaborations. All partners are needed to fully take advantage of the information provided by aDNA sequencing. It is exactly in the interface between genetics and archaeology and anthropology that the most creative and novel research is born. The road towards this goal, however, is paved with problems of many kinds, some of which I shall now discuss.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">2. Lost in translation: terminologies and contexts</span></p>
<p class="noindent">What is in a word (terminology), and what is in a context? I propose that the answer to those questions demands a discussion of how archaeological contexts relate to the formation of culture, and the ways we label and interpret culture. Here archaeologists have recently provided some good case studies to support the notion that context is crucial for the interpretation of genetic data (Booth <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021; Bloxam and Parker Pearson 2022).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_33"></a>However, the answer also relates to how we translate biological/genetic terminology into archaeological terminology, which represents another level of potential misunderstanding in debates, previously discussed by Sørensen (2017). More recently the problem has been re-emphasised by Alexandra Ion (in press). She states:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">There might be two main challenges inherent to the fact that the data is very different in nature: (1) each discipline might have its own ontological reading of the studied object; (2) the scale the data operates on. For these reasons when different disciplines meet on the same territory either tensions or misunderstandings might arise (see article on terminology by Eisenmann</span> et al. <span class="italic">2018). In the case of genetic analysis, osteology, cultural anthropology, isotope studies etc., each of them has their own ontological view ascribed to a person’s identity.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">She rightly suggests that the impact of different ontologies has been somewhat overlooked: ‘Surprisingly though, it seems that precisely this complex process of negotiation and of finding a “meta-language” is almost absent at present’ (Ion 2019, 177, 189; see also Sørensen 2017 for earlier discussion). I venture to propose that right now we are in a phase where sometimes misunderstanding, even misrepresentation, of ‘the other’ has led to a series of partly unfounded critiques, or rather over-interpretations, of what new genetic results imply from both sides. It is in some measure due to the kind of misunderstanding that Ion ascribed to different meta-languages. Geneticists have a specific understanding of genetic admixture and change that cannot easily be translated into archaeological language without simplification. As a result, critical archaeologists have tended to overstate the negative interpretative implications or dangers of at least some genetic results, while some genetic papers on the contrary have tended to over-interpret their results in terms of archaeological and linguistic implications.</p>
<p class="indent">The first step forward is of course to identify those concepts and contexts that can lead to misunderstandings, to which also belongs the concept of ‘ancestry’ with very different meaning in genetics and archaeology. Booth (2020) addressed this issue in a recent discussion paper:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">I think many population geneticists would argue that terms such as ‘population’ and ‘ancestry’ are not euphemisms for race, and do not represent attempts to sanitize racial groups. In the discussion of human genetic diversity, terms like ‘population’ and ‘ancestry’ represent a convenient way of talking about genetic structure (for an accessible summary see Birney</span> et al. <span class="italic">2019). Genetic structure is defined by the genetic data and not by pre-existing population labels.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Here we are at the root of some current misunderstandings, lost in translation from genetic to archaeological meta-language. When a genetic population for convenience is translated into an archaeological culture, such as Yamnaya or Corded Ware, it implies to many archaeologists an implicit correspondence between genes, culture, and ethnic identity, not least when further translated into popular dissemination. Therefore, utmost care and explanation are demanded when translating genetic and archaeological meta-language (Eisenmann <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018). Consequently, neutral terms to characterise genetic admixture processes are now being employed when possible, such as steppe ancestry, Anatolian/farmer ancestry, western and eastern hunter-gatherer ancestry. Accordingly, a discussion about good practice for making interdisciplinary interpretations is mandatory, and for that, a historical perspective provides a useful background (Díaz-Andreu and Coltofean-Arizancu 2021). <a id="page_34"></a>However, the debate is continuing, as it has a much wider scope than archaeology and aDNA (see the most recent summary in Coop 2022).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">3. Big data: towards open access</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Another side of the third science revolution is its powerful use of Big Data. Once archaeological data entered the digitised world, it could be analysed and correlated with other types of data, such as the geodata forming the backbone of GIS (McCoy 2017), or environmental and genetic data (Roberts <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018; Racimo <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). All published genetic data are stored in a global database. This implies that all new aDNA analyses can be compared to previous analyses, as well as to modern reference data. Old data can in this way be re-analysed with new methods, all of which is part of the rapid advance and strength of archaeogenetics. But how do we create open access archaeological databases to match those of aDNA? To be able to reproduce and re-use existing Big Data is a prerequisite for advancing archaeological data analysis to new levels, and to further advance interdisciplinarity. The potential of this has recently been demonstrated when the European Open Access database for pollen diagrams (Fyfe <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2009) was employed to compare changes in landscape openness between the Neolithic and Copper Age/Early Bronze Age with similar genetic changes based on aDNA. When radiocarbon dates were added it revealed major differences between Neolithic and Bronze Age migration patterns (Racimo <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">So far, most archaeological Big Data are stored in national databases and are therefore of limited use. Thus, the full potential of archaeological Big Data has yet to be realised (Perry and Taylor 2018; Huggett 2020). However, lists of radiocarbon dates have been made publicly available in the journal <span class="italic">Radiocarbon</span> since 1959, and can thus be employed in more advanced research crosscutting national borders. Such research has already had a profound effect upon our understanding of prehistoric demography (Hinz <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012; Shennan <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2013; Blanco-Gonzales <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018; Roberts <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019). Therefore, in our recently started ERC Synergy project, Corex, we are creating European-wide databases covering the period from 6000–500 cal BC (<span class="shyphen"><a href="https://www.corex-erc.com">https://www.corex-erc.com</a></span>). They include strontium isotopic samples from humans, archaeobotanical and osteological data from settlement contexts and archaeological burial contexts, just as we employ existing databases for European pollen diagrams and aDNA. The ultimate goal is to transform these research databases into open access databases for archaeological research.</p>
<p class="indent">Combining environmental, genetic and archaeological evidence to produce new integrated interpretations demands a new type of interdisciplinary practice, which in turn raises fundamental questions about how to balance such interpretations (Arponen <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019a; 2019b; 2019c). It puts new demands on all participating parties, but of what kind?</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">4. From interdisciplinarity to transdisciplinarity</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Liv Nilsson Stutz suggests that, in order to create a more productive environment for interdisciplinary collaboration, it is necessary to understand what it takes and that it represents a demanding process of increasing knowledge-sharing. She then suggests a three-phase knowledge-sharing process, moving from ‘multidisciplinarity’, through <a id="page_35"></a>‘interdisciplinarity’ toward ‘transdisciplinarity’ (Stutz 2016). She defines the different stages in the following way:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Multidisciplinarity</span> denotes a model where different disciplines, each providing its own perspective, collaborate by bringing their disciplinary expertise to bear on an issue; <span class="italic">Interdisciplinary</span> work denotes a higher level of integration by analysing, synthesising, and harmonising links between disciplines ‘into a coordinated and coherent whole’; <span class="italic">Transdisciplinarity</span>, even more integrated, creates a unity of intellectual frameworks beyond the disciplinary perspectives. Moving from inter- to trans-disciplinarity thus demands an open forum of intellectual reflection, and additional intellectual labour. It demands a wider context, including comparative knowledge of results from other disciplines. And that inevitably reduces the number of researchers who are capable and willing to provide that extra investment of labour in a new field where such interpretations for the foreseeable future will remain debatable. Until now the most productive way forward has been project teamwork, where archaeologists, geneticists and researchers from other relevant disciplines such as environmental science, historical linguistics and so on, work together, from formulating research goals through to final publication.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">To situate the present debates, we need to understand the ultimate goal of transdisciplinarity. According to Liv Nilsson Stutz, it is a way of integrating all the different voices inside and outside academia that form our perceptions of the past – from cultural, critical heritage to the way we interpret evidence under a shared theoretical framework that understands the complicated processes of genetics and culture interactions – and which are able to situate the results in the present. We are certainly not there yet; rather we are in the middle phase where the two disciplines are grappling to create a shared understanding of genetic and archaeological evidence and their impact in the present. Here, archaeology comes with the burden of a long history of contested and sometimes politicised narratives of the past against a new genetic discipline of ancient DNA without such a historical burden. This imbalance has clearly shaped some of the debates about European prehistory (Frieman and Hofmann 2019).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">5. Genes versus culture</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This field of research is theoretically the most demanding and therefore also contested. Here I propose two themes for further examination:</p>
<div class="num3">
<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">1.</span> How do genetic admixture processes relate to cultural admixture processes?</p>
<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">2.</span> How do we translate biological mating processes into rules of kinship and marriage?</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Genetic admixture processes versus cultural admixture processes</span>. While genetic admixture processes are reasonably well understood, the same is not true of cultural admixture processes. There are several reasons for this; culture and its meanings are under-theorised and thus debated (Kristiansen 2022, 28–30). Therefore, to begin with we need to delineate and theorise what constitute cultural and ethnic identities (Jones 1997). Cultural identities and ethnicities are always formed in relation to and sometimes in opposition to other such identities (Barth 1969; Sahlins 2010). From this arises the theoretical paradox that, while cultures are seemingly autonomous and often studied as such, they are derived from larger <a id="page_36"></a>‘global’ processes of interlinked political economies, which fuel a process of identification with certain cultural and cosmological values and material expressions. They are part of a process of elite formation and elite control, in need of boundaries to exert its dominance by establishing a system of shared values. Over time, cultural identity may come to include other forms of identification; for example, language may lend to it a certain degree of relative autonomy. While nationalism may have taken on more sophisticated and penetrating means of identity formation during the late modern period, it is shaped by the very same processes that led to the emergence of regional identities in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. Those need therefore to be studied with due respect to these larger historical processes.</p>
<p class="indent">From a methodological point of view, boundary formation of various forms can often be demonstrated in the archaeological record, which define ‘us’ and ‘them’ (Hodder 1978; Burmeister and Müller-Schessel 2007). We may assume that complex societies produced more boundaries than less complex societies, internal as well as external. The definition of such boundaries in the archaeological record, however, is only a first step. Next follows the theoretical interpretation of the social and economic processes leading to such divisions in the material record. If they carry any weight, it must be possible to link them to the formation and reproduction of institutions.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span class="italic">Translating biological mating networks into rules of kinship and marriage.</span> This field of research is entirely new, as we have not previously been able to characterise biological mating networks. But how do we move from the biological to the social world, and what is the relation – if any – between ethnic origins and blood ties, and what is the role of kinship in maintaining or changing such relationships? And how do we define kinship in relevant prehistoric terms (Booth <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020)? Kinship institutions and their rules of marriage, inheritance, fosterage, adoption and so on represented the daily conduct of life within the tens of thousands of households that increasingly covered Europe during the Neolithic and later on during the Bronze Age. They are therefore fundamental to our understanding of the dynamics of social and economic reproduction in time and space. One of the most common principles of marriage in the anthropological literature is the matrilateral mother’s brother’s daughter cross-cousin marriage, or alternatively the patrilateral father’s sister’s daughter. It represents an interpersonal way to create alliances between lineages (Sahlins 1968, chapter 4). Thus, traditional marriage is not strictly personal but rather a marriage of families. In the words of Marshall Sahlins (1968, 10): ‘kinship is a fundamental ground of peaceful human discourse. The wide extension of kinship idioms, relations, and groups in tribal societies represents another way to seek peace’.</p>
<p class="indent">However, to unravel marriage and kinship relations demands in-depth analyses of local community cemeteries, megaliths or groups of barrows (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Mittnik <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Sjögren <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021; Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). It further demands a proper understanding of the vast corpus of kinship practices accumulated in social anthropology (Lévi-Strauss 1969) and in Indo-European studies (Olsen 2019; 2020) in order to translate biological mating patterns into rules of social kinship. It is, therefore, still a field of research in its infancy, but it represents a potential for archaeology to contribute new types of evidence to existing anthropological knowledge of kinship. As kinship institutions are integrated into larger networks, we may further assume that such case studies are valid for a region corresponding to the geographical origin of the analysed individuals. Even if that provides <a id="page_37"></a>some ground for generalisation, we need many more in-depth local studies to provide larger spatial and temporal coverage than we have today, as we may assume that such institutions alter over time and may also display geographical variation.</p>
<p class="h">FROM HERE ONWARDS: WHAT IS NEXT?</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if environmental DNA was introduced 20 years ago by Eske Willerslev and his team (Willerslev <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2003), it is only now that we are capable of realising its full potential. This in turn will open up completely new doors to previously hidden genetic knowledge about daily life at prehistoric settlements. Sampling cultural layers and other settlement contexts will potentially reveal which plants, animals, pathogens were around, and possibly also human genomes. Over the past 20 years background reference libraries for the DNA identification of thousands of species have been built up, allowing the determination of plants, animals and pathogens from prehistoric settlement layers and sediments. Also, knowledge of what soil conditions – minerals and other materials – that favour DNA preservation has increased. However, human DNA has been less successfully identified, even if we can observe progress here (Vernot <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021).</p>
<p class="indent">In our recently started Corex ERC Synergy project we shall employ eDNA from 40–50 prehistoric settlement sites from the period 6000–500 cal BC in temperate Europe, which will form a local community-based window to understand larger processes of change unveiled by Big Data (<span class="shyphen"><a href="https://www.corex-erc.com">https://www.corex-erc.com</a></span>). In this way eDNA holds the potential to provide a high-resolution window to living conditions at local sites, and it also holds a future potential to provide an alternative source of human DNA, that can balance the highly selective and limited number of prehistoric skeletons available for aDNA analysis. It will provide a richer prehistory, but also present new theoretical and not least methodological challenges of how to balance and integrate local and supra local processes of change. It will also provide a new way forward for sampling of human DNA, since settlement evidence represent a nearly unlimited resource, with excavations continuously providing new sampling contexts. Thus, we may now be entering a second phase of the third science revolution.</p>
