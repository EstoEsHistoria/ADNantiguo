<p class="chaptitle">Ancestry and identity in the Balkans and the Carpathian basin between the 5th and 3rd millennia cal BC</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch9-1"><span class="italic1">Bianca Preda-Bălănică and Yoan Diekmann</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">Thousands of kurgans (burial mounds) were built on the plains landscapes of the Balkans and the Carpathian basin during the first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC. For a long time, they have been interpreted as belonging to ‘newcomers’, that is, steppe migrants who already started to arrive in the 5th millennium cal BC, in contrast to flat burial grounds traditionally assigned to ‘local’ communities. By bringing together information about the genetic ancestry of individuals and the mortuary archaeology of burial practices, we investigate the relationship between descent and identity in the kurgans and flat cemeteries of the region. While many individuals with no steppe-related ancestry are buried according to Balkan-Carpathian basin burial practices, we find a significant number of them were also buried following Pontic-Caspian steppe practices. Our results show that operating with the prevalent dichotomy only obscures the complexity of processes taking place in the region in the second half of the 4th millennium and first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC, suggesting ancestry is at most one factor amongst others contributing to social identity.</span></p>
<p class="h">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="noindent">In the past decade, palaeogenetics have not only reshaped our understanding of European prehistory, but also deeply influenced archaeological research practice. Since 2015, the well-known 20th-century archaeological theory of a massive migration from the eastern steppes into central Europe in the 3rd millennium cal BC has been the research focus of multiple teams of geneticists, resulting in high-profile publications (Allentoft <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015; Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015). Reactions from the archaeological side were not long in coming, either of support and engagement or rejection and caution towards the shortcomings of the approach (Kristiansen <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2017; Furholt 2018). Given the enormous potential to further the understanding of past societies, researchers are currently seeking to build a fruitful dialogue and collaboration between archaeology and genetics.</p>
<p class="indent">With this paper, we aim to explore ways in which the two disciplines can pose questions and interpret the archaeological record collaboratively. The focus is on the arrival of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the Pontic-Caspian steppe into the Balkans and the Carpathian basin, starting from the 5th, but especially during the 3rd millennium cal BC, and its impact on the transformation of burial practices in the region. Thousands of kurgans were built in the plain landscapes that were traditionally interpreted as belonging to ‘newcomers’, steppe <a id="page_108"></a>migrants, as opposed to flat burial grounds assigned to ‘locals’. However, how dichotomous is this scenario really? Here, the relationship between descent and identity in kurgans and flat cemeteries is investigated by bringing together information about the genetic ancestry of individuals and burial practices.</p>
<p class="indent">Mortuary archaeology has long been concerned with the interrelation between funerary practices and the expression of individuals’ identity. In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers examined the display of social identity in mortuary contexts and established the key concept of the <span class="italic">social persona</span> of the deceased, a ‘composite of the social identities maintained in life and recognized as appropriate for consideration at death’ (Goodenough 1965, 7; Binford 1971, 17). This paradigm was overturned in the 1980s, with studies arguing that identities expressed in mortuary rituals are not mere reflections of social identity, but rather idealised and manipulated for the purpose of status aggrandisement and social advertisement (Parker Pearson 1982, 112). The way ‘identities’ are understood today is not as static and fixed anymore, but negotiated relationally and contextually (Fowler 2013, 511).</p>
<p class="h">BURIAL PRACTICES IN THE BALKANS-CARPATHIAN BASIN AND THE PONTIC-CASPIAN STEPPE</p>
<p class="noindent">In the Balkans and the Carpathian basin, in the second half of the 5th millennium cal BC, the custom of burying the dead in flat cemeteries separate from settlements was common in the Kodjadermen-Gumelniţa-Karanovo VI, Tiszapolgár-Bodrogkeresztúr, and – to a smaller extent – in the Bubanj<span class="italic">-</span>Salcuţa<span class="italic">-</span>Krivodol societies, while documented burials assigned to the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture are almost non-existent (Bognár-Kutzián 1963; Bailey 2000; 2005). Individuals were most often buried crouched on either the right or left side, their position and grave goods, including ceramic vessels, tools and ornaments made of various materials, sometimes being gender-differentiated (Sofaer Derevenski 1997; Bailey 2000). In the coastal region of Bulgaria, cemeteries contained wealthy graves of individuals laid on their backs or crouched on their sides, some accompanied by thousands of exquisite grave goods, for example made of gold, copper, or shells (Krauß <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">A dramatic change occurred in the 4th millennium cal BC, as only very scarce indications of habitation and a handful of graves are documented in the Balkan lowlands in the first half of the millennium, and a similar decline is recorded in the Carpathian basin as well (Horváth and Virág 2003; Georgieva 2018, 103). The region markedly resettled only in the second half of the 4th millennium cal BC, with the trans-regional phenomenon of Baden, Coţofeni-Kostolac in central Europe and the central Balkans, and Ezero in Bulgaria (Demoule 2017, 57–8). Funerary customs were heterogeneous, with both inhumation and cremation in flat graves and under small mounds being attested in the Baden-Coţofeni area, and flat inhumations and cremations in the Ezero area (Leshtakov 2011; Sachsse 2011; Diaconescu 2020). The first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC is marked by the preservation of these burial traditions, but also the emergence of new ones. Flat isolated graves or cemeteries continue to exist north and south of the lower Danube, sometimes in connection with settlement sites, while burial mounds with stone covering and stone cist burials are documented in the intra-Carpathian region (Ciugudean 2011; Frînculeasa <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). Inhumations of individuals crouched <a id="page_109"></a>on their sides accompanied by local grave goods, especially pottery, are most common, although cremations are also found.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Pontic-Caspian steppe, the mid-5th millennium cal BC was the start of a deep transformation of burial practices. This is the period when monumental funerary architecture in the steppe emerges, with simple, small, stone or earth constructions marking the graves (Rassamakin 2011, table 1). Prestigious grave goods were placed in graves, including stone sceptres/maceheads, ornaments, tools and weapons made of shell, gold, copper and flint (Govedarica 2004). Monumental architecture developed during the 4th millennium cal BC into elaborate funerary structures with ditches, cromlechs, stone circles and rings made with black and yellow clay, covered by mounds (Rassamakin 2011, table 1). In this period, innovations including arsenic bronzes, new weapon types such as shaft-hole axes and daggers, and wooden wagons circulated across the steppe, and were incorporated in the burial practices of different societies, such as Usatovo and Maykop (Anthony 2007). In the first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC, simpler, larger earthen kurgans were built over Yamnaya burials (Rassamakin 2011, table 1). Even though grave goods were rather scarce in these burials, regionally variable preferences for pottery, tanged daggers or other metal items, bone pins, anthropomorphic stone stelae, hair rings or necklaces made of animal teeth are noted (Preda-Bălănică 2021, 152). Various traditions of placing the deceased in graves existed, either extended, supine, or crouched on the side, each with their own timeline. Of these, the supine position with raised knees is the earliest and most lasting one, and became a trademark of steppe funerary rituals along with red ochre staining (Rassamakin 2013, 116, fig. 11).</p>
<p class="indent">In this study, we examine the relationship between the genetic ancestry of individuals and the funerary rituals performed at their death to explore aspects of individual and group identity. Two non-trivial conceptual links have to be made explicit: genetic ancestry and the identity of individuals throughout their life, on the one hand; and the identity of individuals throughout their life and funerary rituals performed at their death, on the other. First, biological relatedness has previously been argued to not necessarily be the only or even the strongest articulation of identity for the living, as concepts of kin are culturally and contextually specific (Büster 2022). Secondly, the identity of the deceased undergoes a transformation during the mortuary process that leaves behind the record which archaeologists are studying (Fowler 2013, 511).</p>
<p class="h">ANCESTRY IN THE BALKAN-CARPATHIAN BASIN AND PONTIC-CASPIAN STEPPE</p>
<p class="noindent">Soon after technological, molecular and computational advances made it possible to sequence ancient individuals at genomic scale, palaeogenetic studies confirmed earlier results based on mitochondrial DNA that European early farmers (EFs) were genetically distinct from contemporary Holocene hunter-gatherers (HGs) (Bramanti <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2009; Skoglund <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012), thereby strongly supporting the demic diffusion model of the Neolithic revolution. Fuelled by rapid increase in the number of genomes that could be sequenced, a second longstanding archaeological migration hypothesis was supported shortly afterwards, by finding steppe-related genetic ancestry from the Pontic-Caspian region across late Neolithic Europe (Allentoft <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015; Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015). (The term ‘steppe-related ancestry’ accounts for the <a id="page_110"></a>fact that the ancestry profile of the steppe is currently insufficiently sampled. Despite this, we refer to it simply as ‘steppe ancestry’ for the sake of brevity in the remainder of this chapter.) The success of genetic ancestry in the context of major prehistoric migrations firmly established it in the palaeogenetic community as a way to describe population structure, in Europe most commonly as a three-way admixture model with HG, EF and a steppe component (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014; Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015). Within such a model, the geographic location of the eastern Balkans and Carpathian basin destines these regions to act as a contact zone between central European – dominated by Aegean farmers admixed with limited spatio-temporally varying amounts of HG ancestry – and Pontic-Caspian steppe populations, as indeed attested by occasional findings of individuals with steppe ancestry starting from the 5th millennium cal BC (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018). The origin of steppe ancestry itself has been modelled as a mixture of older ancestries of geographically adjacent HG populations in eastern Europe and the Caucasus (Jones <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">Despite its pervasive use and often being the basis for the more consequential archaeological interpretations of the genetic data in palaeogenetic papers, the concept of ancestry has been criticised on multiple grounds. While archaeologists have for example picked up on the knee-jerk interpretations of changes in ancestry as ‘massive migrations’ without considering the finer impact on social realities (Furholt 2018), population geneticists have pointed out conceptual problems. Ancestry in palaeogenetics is loosely defined and routinely derived from genetic similarity measures, often in relation to reference populations composed and labelled <span class="italic">a priori</span> (Coop 2022). These ultimately arbitrary choices implicitly determine the time periods in which the resulting categories are archaeologically meaningful, that is, they represent conceivably interacting populations, but do not preclude their use in other contexts (Mathieson and Scally 2020). Moreover, while ancestral populations corresponding to Holocene HG, EF and steppe ancestries are separated by sufficient amounts of genetic drift to be discernible based on allele frequency differentiation, once all major ancestry components are present and admixed, demographic events tend to leave more subtle shifts not sufficiently pronounced to reconstruct them from summary statistics of allele frequency differences.</p>
<p class="indent">In the following, we set out to illustrate how some of these criticisms may be addressed. We ask what the relationship is between ancestry and burial practices, thereby considering the migrational impact beyond mere genetic makeup. In particular, we avoid the troublesome interpretation of migration as replacement of the local population, by explicitly incorporating a cultural layer, here focusing on social identity. As discussed in the previous section, the link between funerary practices and social identity is complex; the same is true for ancestry. When shared ancestry is due to biological relatedness, direct remembrance of origin is a realistic option, but finding and inferring relatedness or timing admixture to a few generations in the past is challenging. Instead, we use ancestry here as a proxy for differences in appearance, the (at least partially) genetically determined aspect relevant for identity that is directly ‘accessible’ to the individual and their social group. We stress that correlation between ancestry and phenotype is limited, and the relation of the latter to identity is again complex. Some phenotypic traits could in theory be predicted directly from genetic data, but most ancient genomes are sequenced shallowly mostly at ascertained neutral markers that by definition do not influence any phenotype, as these are the only ones reflecting demography. We note that powerful recent phasing and imputation approaches may partially alleviate this problem.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="page_111"></a>MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>
<p class="noindent">We gathered archaeological information from publications on 97 individuals for which genome data were available that were discovered in mortuary contexts in the study region, dated roughly between 5000/4900 and 2500/2400 cal BC by means of either radiocarbon dates or relative chronology (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-1">Fig. 9.1</a>). We partitioned the individuals into two distinct phases by splitting them at <span class="italic">c</span>. 3500 cal BC, as steppe ancestry is rare (a single individual) and burials of Pontic-Caspian steppe character are absent in our dataset before 3500 cal BC. We note that the samples are not evenly distributed spatio-temporally; the Carpathian basin and eastern Bulgaria are better represented than the area north of the lower Danube, and there are about twice as many samples dated between 5000–3500 cal BC (n=61) than 3500–2500 cal BC (n=36). The burial ritual of the selected contexts was evaluated and labelled as being of ‘Balkan/Carpathian basin’ (BCB) or ‘Pontic-Caspian steppe’ (PCS) character. To this end, a combination of diagnostic criteria was considered, for example the absence or presence of a burial mound, the funerary structure, ochre staining, and the position and orientation of the deceased, as well as the accepted assignments in the archaeological literature.</p>
<p class="indent">We retrieved the genomes for the 97 individuals from the Allen Ancient DNA Resource version 50.0 (<span class="weblink"><span class="shyphen"><a href="https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data">https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/allen-ancient-dna-resource-aadr-downloadable-genotypes-present-day-and-ancient-dna-data</a></span></span>, accessed March 2022). The proportion of steppe ancestry was estimated with <span class="italic">qpAdm</span> from the Admixtools package (Patterson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012) based on a reference set of individuals labelled as Yamnaya. The logistic regression shown in <a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-3">Figure 9.3</a> was computed in R (R Core Team 2022) with <span class="italic">glm</span> and <span class="italic">logit</span> link function.

<p class="h"><a id="page_112"></a>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="noindent">Before 3500 cal BC, we find only a single individual with steppe ancestry in our dataset and no burials of Pontic-Caspian steppe character, in line with long-range migration between the Balkan/Carpathian basin and the Pontic-Caspian steppe being rare in that period. The individual with steppe ancestry was dated to <span class="italic">c</span>. 4606-4447 cal BC and found in Grave 29 from Smyadovo (I2181) (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018, 200). Here, an adult man was laid in the grave pit in a crouched position on his left side, east–west oriented, along with two vessels, a flint and a string of beads of serpentinite, bone and <span class="italic">Spondylus</span> (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-2">Fig. 9.2, 3</a>) (Chohadzieh and Mihaylova 2014, 45). The burial ritual shows similarities to the other graves on the site and to contemporary cemeteries in the eastern Balkans (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-2">Fig. 9.2, 4</a>). The individual is inferred to have <span class="italic">c</span>. 40% steppe ancestry, but the low genome coverage precludes any attempt to date any actual admixture event, which could in theory be as recent as one generation in the past. Thus, in this particular case, genetic ancestry was not acknowledged in any way in the burial ritual. We do not know if the steppe origin was remembered, part of the identity of the individual during his life, or if it was obscured during funerary rituals (Frieman and Hofmann 2019, 537). David Anthony (2019, 42) suggested a possible interpretation, occasional marriage between higher-status families in the area and steppe people from the Volga as a means to secure peaceful interactions and exchanges under the umbrella of kinship, this individual remaining in the Varna region and identifying as a member of the native family.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet, although not available to be included into our dataset, graves displaying typical steppe burial practices also exist in the region. The grave from Csongrád-Kettőshalom, dated to <span class="italic">c</span>. 4442–4243 cal BC, is described as showing DNA similar to individuals from the Khvalynsk cemetery (Russia), which exemplifies the presence of individuals presumably originating from the steppe region in the Carpathian basin in the 5th millennium cal BC (Preda-Bălănică 2021, tab. 3; Anthony <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022, 38). However, unlike in Smyadovo, here the presumed origin of the individual was acknowledged and symbolised in the burial ritual (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-2">Fig. 9.2, 1</a>). The mourners were familiar with the burial practices from the steppe and the rules were strictly followed; ochre was procured and sprinkled in large quantities over the pit bottom and the deceased individual, who was laid with the head towards the west, on his back, with raised knees, and an ochre lump was placed next to him, along with a 13.2 cm long obsidian blade, limestone and <span class="italic">Spondylus</span> shell beads, and beads made of curved copper plate (Ecsedy 1971, 9).</p>
<p class="indent">Currently, there are no autosomal genomic data available for other sites displaying a typical steppe burial ritual and considered indicative of the arrival of the steppe ancestry into the region in the 5th millennium cal BC, such as Giurgiuleşti, or Decea Mureşului, to mention only two (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-2">Fig. 9.2, 2</a>). Mitochondrial genomes were sequenced for Decea Mureşului (Hervella <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015), but these do not allow steppe ancestry to be quantified.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_114"></a>Although relatively few samples (n=36) dated between the second half of the 4th until the middle of the 3rd millennium cal BC, our dataset contains variation both in steppe ancestry and burial practices, allowing for a statistical approach. We test the relationship between steppe ancestry and burial practices via logistic regression (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-3">Fig. 9.3</a>), with the continuous proportion of steppe ancestry as predictor and the binary burial practice as response variable. The better ancestry allows to predict burial practice, the stronger we would infer its impact on identity to be. Interestingly, while many individuals with no steppe ancestry are buried according to BCB practices, many examples for PCS burials exist as well, suggesting ancestry is at most one factor amongst others contributing to social identity. In the following, we discuss some striking cases in more detail.</p>
<p class="indent">Several graves north and south of the lower Danube are particularly interesting, such are Individual no. 6 from a burial mound in Merichleri (I2165), Feature 3 containing two individuals in Mound 5/Beli Breyag (Bul6 and Bul8) (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-4">Fig. 9.4, 1</a>), and Grave 1 from Glăvăneştii Vechi, Mound 1/1949 (I11912) (Comşa 1987; Alexandrov <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016, 154, fig. 3; Iliev 2018). None of the individuals found in these graves are confidently inferred to have steppe ancestry, as even though a model with steppe ancestry fits individual I2165 reasonably well, it lacks Eastern HG ancestry and is better modelled as a mixture of Balkan and Caucasus HGs. These are secondary graves dug into already existing mounds, with the specification that in Merichleri the oldest burial was a cremation accompanied by a small mound covered with limestones. The way of disposing of the dead illustrates steppe burial practices, as seen for instance in Mednikarovo, mound 2, grave 1 (Bul4), which is inferred to have <span class="italic">c</span>. 50% steppe ancestry (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-4">Fig. 9.4, 2</a>) (Panayotov and Alexandrov 1995, 88, fig. 6). Individuals were laid in supine position with raised knees or slightly crouched on their sides, with arms bent at the elbows, oriented towards west or east; in some cases the bones of the deceased, especially the skull, and the pit bottom were stained with ochre. No grave goods were found with the exception of Individual no. 6 from Merichleri, who was accompanied by a stone ball and a small askos pot.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_115"></a>Steppe mortuary practices are clearly present in the Mezőcsát-Hörcsögös site, a mound built on top of a former bi-ritual Baden burial ground (Kalicz 1999). The graves of interest here are nos 1, 3, 4 and 10. In Grave 1 (I5116) a child was buried in a rectangular pit with rounded corners, west–east oriented, lying supine with knees initially raised and subsequently fallen to the right side and with the arms along the body. Close to the chest, a cup typical of local Copper Age pottery types was placed (Kalicz 1999, 59, figs 9, 1, 17, 4). Grave 3 (I5117) (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-4">Fig. 9.4, 3</a>) contained an adult individual buried in an oval pit, lying supine with raised knees, with one arm on the chest and the other along the body, oriented south-west–north-east (Kalicz 1999, 59, figs 6, 3, 9, 3). Similarly, in Grave 10 (I5119), a child was laid supine with the knees initially raised and fallen to the right side and arms along the body, north–south oriented (<a href="15_Chapter09.xhtml#fig9-4">Fig. 9.4, 4</a>) (Kalicz 1999, 67, fig. 8, 1). Notably, the individual in Grave 4 (I5118) is buried in an unusual manner, initially laid in sitting position and subsequently falling forwards (Kalicz 1999, 63, fig. 6, 4). None of the above individuals are inferred to have steppe ancestry, although we caution that Grave 1 (I5116) has not enough coverage for confident estimation.</p>
<p class="indent">Researchers interpreted this discovery as a burial mound of Yamnaya migrants built on top of a former local burial ground in the late 4th or early 3rd millennium cal BC (Schasse 2011, 132; Heyd 2011, 538; Dani 2020, 4). While such a hypothesis is supported by numerous other examples of graves displaying attributes of the Yamnaya burial ritual dug into previous settlement sites or burial grounds and then covered by mounds (Heyd 2011, 542), in this case the burial did not include people of steppe origin, but contained people of local origin. Those who built the funerary monument placed the dead according to steppe burial practices.</p>
<p class="indent">Our analysis also brought to light that in the first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC, individuals with steppe genetic ancestry were found in funerary contexts that do not bear any signs of steppe burial practices, here in Vučedol contexts. This is exemplified by Grave 17 at the site of Beli Manastir (I3499), where an individual was buried who derived <span class="italic">c</span>. 20% of their ancestry from the steppe. The 25–30-year-old male was laid on the bottom of a circular pit in crouched position on the left side, with legs flexed and arms bent and brought towards the face, south–north oriented (Miloglav 2019, 133). Another example comes from Vučedol, where in the youngest construction horizon (III) two contracted skeletons were found in a double burial (pit 9/1985) (Forenbaher 1994, fig. 5). Individual 1 (I4175) was a 9–10-year-old male inferred to have <span class="italic">c</span>. 55% steppe ancestry buried together with a 17–19-year-old female, for whom there are unfortunately no autosomal genomic data available (Hincak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2007, table 1).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_117"></a>To summarise, our dataset is currently underpowered to evaluate the period between 5000–3500 cal BC systematically. Yet we highlight examples of individuals where genetic ancestry either was or was not acknowledged in the burial ritual, suggesting social complexity with respect to identity already before the later migration. Continued research efforts will shed more light on the impact of the arrival of steppe-related ancestry and steppe burial practices in the region.</p>
<p class="indent">For the period between 3500–2500 cal BC, the cases discussed above clearly demonstrate that communities living in the Balkans and the Carpathian basin were building and using mounds as burial places, as well as practising burial rituals originating in the Pontic-Caspian steppe. The fact that not all people buried in kurgans had steppe origins is by no means a novel idea. In the last centuries of the 4th millennium cal BC burial mounds displaying a combination of steppe and local burial practices emerged in the plains north of the lower Danube, the eastern Balkans and the Carpathian basin, before the Yamnaya migration (Frînculeasa 2020). Building burial mounds peaked during the first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC, concurrent with a significant influx of steppe ancestry into the region, presumably as a direct consequence of the above-mentioned migration (Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015). However, isotopic studies have found that during this period a kurgan located in the Hungarian Plain, for example, was used as a burial place by individuals likely originating from the Apuseni Mountains (Gerling <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012). For the moment, the small number of available genomes along with the absence of absolute dates makes it impossible to further distinguish between the two phases that were identified on archaeological grounds, that is, the last centuries of the 4th millennium cal BC, before the emergence of the typical Yamnaya graves in the region around 3100 cal BC, and after this moment until around 2500 cal BC, in order to investigate how the relation between genetic ancestry and burial practices was impacted. However, the results indicate that the spread of ancestry and the spread of ideas are not congruent, and are both relevant when considering such complex phenomena as identity.</p>
<p class="h">CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK</p>
<p class="noindent">The arrival of steppe ancestry into south-eastern and then central and western Europe was concurrent amongst others with significant changes in economy and lifestyle, but the most obvious and unambiguous are transformations in mortuary rituals. Steppe ancestry has generally been associated with a specific set of burial practices, for which Martin Furholt (2019) coined the term ‘Single Grave Burial Ritual’. The bottom-up approach taken in this study shows that correlation between the genetic ancestry of individuals and their identity expressed in mortuary practices should not be assumed, but investigated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="indent">In several instances, individuals without steppe ancestry were put to rest in ways typical of steppe burial practices. Alin Frînculeasa (2020, 55) considers that certain aspects of <a id="page_118"></a>steppe burial practices were adopted by local groups wishing to display their status and wealth, while Marja Ahola (2020) talks about the spread of a ‘steppe originated religion’. However, the mechanisms of this process are largely unknown and further insights could be provided by the detailed analysis of funerary contexts. Communities use the mortuary arena to make socio-political statements (Fowler 2013, 513); building a burial mound or not, the arrangement of funerary structures, the position and orientation in which the deceased are laid, and the selection of grave goods are therefore not accidental, but convey messages about individual and group identity. Likewise, individuals with steppe genetic ancestry were buried without any acknowledgement in burial practices of their origin, although we caution that this is currently illustrated by two examples only. As can be seen from our dataset, these coexist in the same space and time with graves of individuals with genetic steppe ancestry buried according to steppe burial practices and graves of individuals with Aegean farmer and Balkan hunter-gatherer ancestry, typically found in central Europe at the time, buried according to funerary practices in the different areas of the Balkans and the Carpathian basin. These results show that operating with the dichotomy between ‘local’ and ‘newcomer’ only obscures the complexity of processes taking place in the region in the second half of the 4th and first half of the 3rd millennium cal BC.</p>
<p class="indent">Although based only on a limited sample, we provide intriguing observations prompting further research. Strategic sampling of all graves in a burial mound could shed light on the different phases of its construction, and on the group(s) participating in the process. The interdisciplinary study of burials with methods from aDNA, stable isotope, bioarchaeology and funerary archaeology enables researchers to piece together complex narratives about individuals in the past, including their genetic ancestry, their mobility, activity patterns and diet, their group membership and social identity during their lifetime, as well as their identity as expressed in mortuary rituals. Only then can we hope to fully understand mobility and migration, interaction and admixture, transmission and transformation in a landscape shared by the living and the dead.</p>
