<p class="chaptitle">Islands apart? Genomic perspectives on the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition in Ireland</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch11-1"><span class="italic1">Lara M. Cassidy</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">The Mesolithic and Neolithic cultures of Britain and Ireland were both intimately related and worlds apart. The islands also have distinct histories of archaeological thought surrounding the nature of Neolithisation. In this chapter, I consider the agricultural transition in Ireland through the lens of ancient genomics and compare it to that of Britain. The origins, isolation and legacy of Ireland’s Late Mesolithic population are reflected upon in the light of new genetic data and archaeological discussion. I then turn my attention to the source and size of Ireland’s Neolithic population. By combining recently published datasets from three genomic surveys of France, including a key sample from Escalles (a Neolithic causewayed enclosure near Calais), I find a potential shared origin for both British and Irish farming communities in the Chasséo-Michelsberg culture of the northern French coast. I estimate a large number of incoming migrants to the islands, perhaps in the tens of thousands, which could imply multiple and long-lasting streams of migration from the continent. Finally, the genomic evidence for patriliny and kinship-based hierarchy in Neolithic Ireland is discussed.</span></p>
<p class="h">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="noindent">A decade has passed since the publication of the first ancient human genome sequence from Europe, belonging to a Copper Age man from the Ötztal Alps (Keller <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012). The authors found him most closely related to present-day Sardinians and noted that this may reflect a relatively recent diffusion of Neolithic people across Italy, followed by further demographic shifts on the mainland. However, with only a single genome they were cautious in their interpretations. At that time, human geneticists were conflicted as regards to the origins of Europe’s gene pool, with some studies arguing for long-term population continuity since the Palaeolithic (Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2005; Soares <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2010). These results were further used to support models of agricultural spread that centred on indigenous adoption, with only a minor role for migrants. But at the same time, improvements in excavation and dating schemes were sharpening up the chronologies of Europe’s Neolithisation and the picture emerging in many regions was one of abrupt bursts of agricultural expansion, with little evidence of the transitional economies expected in adoptionist models (Rowley-Conwy 2011).</p>
<p class="indent">Models centred on the large-scale movements of people were later vindicated by a quick succession of ancient genomics papers that demonstrated that population turnovers accompanied Neolithic spread in central Europe (Gamba <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014), Scandinavia (Skoglund <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014), Iberia (Günther <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015; Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015) and Ireland <a id="page_148"></a>(Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016). Incoming farmers to these regions were shown to derive the majority of their ancestry from a population closely related to that of the Neolithic of western Anatolia (Broushaki <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016). The first Neolithic genome from Britain and Ireland, belonging to a woman from a megalithic tomb at Ballynahatty, Co. Down (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016), derived approximately 80% of her ancestry from this source. The remaining 20% stemmed from admixture events with European hunter-gatherers that occurred as her ancestors spread across the continent, many through the Mediterranean route of expansion (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016; Olalde <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018). France appears to have been a particular hotspot for such admixture (Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Seguin-Orlando <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021). Today, genomic data from approximately 170 British and Irish Neolithic individuals exist (Olalde <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018; Brace <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Sánchez-Quinto <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Scheib <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Dulias <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022; Patterson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022; Fowler <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022), all showing similar profiles to Ballynahatty. Gene flow from hunter-gatherer populations on the islands into farming communities appears to have been minimal. The only current evidence that it took place comes from cave sites and a shell midden in the west of Scotland (Brace <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019) and a court tomb in the west of Ireland (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">From the genomic data, it is then clear that we are dealing with a colonisation model for the introduction of agriculture to Ireland and Britain. Bayesian analyses of radiocarbon datasets are also in harmony with this conclusion, implying that the Neolithisation of the islands was a relatively speedy affair (Whittle <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2011; Whitehouse <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014; McLaughlin <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016). However, in the past, archaeological opinion on the relative contributions of local and migrant groups has been decidedly mixed. One survey found that those who specialised in the Irish transition were more open to the possibility of a colonisation event, although the most popular answer was ‘unsure’, while British researchers were more likely to stress the complexity of the process and relate this to combination models involving both adoption and migration (Warren 2008). Indeed, models that fell close to one or other extreme have previously been branded as polarising and unhelpful (Cummings and Harris 2011). However, a polar position does not necessitate a less complex or accurate view of a process. A massive influx of new people over generations would still have resulted in a rich tapestry of local and migrant interactions across the islands. Here the questions of tempo and relative population sizes are key.</p>
<p class="indent">The potential intricacies of Neolithic migration to the islands have been much dissected (Sheridan 2007; 2010; Whittle <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2011; Thomas 2022). According to Whittle <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2011), farming communities appear to have arrived on the south-east edges of England around the 41st century cal BC and, after several centuries of consolidation in the south, spread abruptly into most other regions <span class="italic">c.</span> 3800 cal BC. The earliest evidence of cereals and rectangular houses in Ireland dates to 3720–3680 cal BC (Cooney <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2011; Whitehouse <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014), with the initiation of court tomb construction (<span class="italic">c.</span> 3700–3570 cal BC) beginning soon afterwards (Schulting <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012). There is also incontrovertible evidence for an earlier presence of Neolithic people at Poulnabrone portal tomb, where four individuals of the same ancestry as Ballynahatty were interred <span class="italic">c.</span> 3820–3745 cal BC (Schulting 2014; Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Notably, Alison Sheridan has suggested a distinct stream of migration from Brittany may have been responsible for the construction of closed megalithic chambers and simple passage tombs in Ireland around 4000 cal BC (Sheridan 2010; 2016), although relevant radiocarbon evidence remains scant (but see Schulting <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_149"></a>A multi-disciplinary approach is required to address some of the above complexities and tease apart any differences between the two islands over the course of the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition. Ancient genomic data are a new and useful tool with which to understand prehistoric demography and social organisation, although they are by no means an investigative Swiss army knife. In this spirit, the current chapter will provide an up-to-date genomic perspective on the Neolithisation of Ireland. The origins and demography of Ireland’s Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic populations will be considered in the context of those from Britain, as well as the potential forms of social organisation that existed among the island’s megalithic communities.</p>
<p class="h">THE IRISH LATE MESOLITHIC</p>
<p class="noindent">Defining the demographic characteristics of Ireland’s Mesolithic population on the eve of agriculture is vital to our understanding of the Neolithic colonisation event. The central question is one of population size. The larger the island’s Late Mesolithic population, the harder it is to explain their minimal genetic contribution to farming communities without invoking some degree of violent conflict or social exclusion. A large effective population size would also suggest higher levels of connectedness and inward migration from societies across the sea. Analysis of the first two Irish hunter-gatherer genomes has, however, revealed signatures of isolation and historically small population sizes (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). These results are reflected upon here, in the light of new genetic datasets (Antonio <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Jensen <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Brunel <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020) and archaeological discussion (Warren 2021; Chapple <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">Despite the 4000-year duration of the island’s Mesolithic, sites with human remains dated to the period number in the single digits (Meiklejohn and Woodman 2012). At present, genomic data have been successfully retrieved from two male individuals from cave sites in the west of the island. One genome from Killuragh (Woodman <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2017) dates to the Late Mesolithic (4793–4608 cal BC; 5725±55 BP; UBA-40235), while the other, from Sramore (Kador <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014), falls close to the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition (4225–3961 cal BC; 5227±36 BP; UB-15772). Both can be considered part of the ‘Western Hunter-Gatherer’ (WHG) population (Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016), within which they form a distinct genetic grouping (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). For practical purposes, I designate this population ‘Irish hunter-gatherers’, although an individual in possession of this ancestry may not necessarily follow a hunting and gathering subsistence strategy, just as a modern individual of ‘Irish’ ancestry need never have set foot in Ireland. Indeed, given the late date of SRA62 it is possible this individual had contact with early agricultural communities arriving on the island.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Origins</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The earliest observations of WHG ancestry come from Spain and Italy <span class="italic">c.</span> 17,000–15,000 cal BC (Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016; Bortolini <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021), although the lineage’s increased affinity to West Asian populations relative to earlier Europeans implies an ultimate origin further east. The spread of this ancestry northwards is associated with the expansion of temperate forests at the beginning of the Holocene, and with them diverse Mesolithic industries. In the west, WHG groups mixed with a divergent lineage associated with the cold-adapted Magdalenian culture (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-1">Fig. 11.1</a>). The persistence of Magdalenian-related ancestry into the Mesolithic is most prominent in Iberia, where it existed in admixed form as early as 17,000 cal BC (Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016; Villalba-Mouco <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019). In contrast, the Mesolithic populations in Britain and Ireland have little detectable ancestry from Magdalenian-related sources (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; <a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-1">Fig. 11.1</a>). Britain and Ireland are believed to have been abandoned during the Younger Dryas with the exception of seasonal hunting groups (Dowd and Carden 2016), so this lack of continuity is not unexpected.</p>
<p class="image" id="fig11-1"><a id="page_150"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0150-01.jpg" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 11.1. The genetic affinities of Irish hunter-gatherers. The left-hand panels provide estimates of Magdalenian-related ancestry in European hunter-gatherer populations through time, estimated using qpAdm (Patterson</span> et al. <span class="italic">2012). Population replacement can be observed in the north-west, with higher levels of Magdalenian ancestry seen in Spanish and French Mesolithic samples compared to Britain and Ireland. The right-hand panels show the results of outgroup</span> F<span class="italic"><sub class="calibre11">3</sub>-statistics, with larger, darker values indicating stronger genetic affinity to the Irish hunter-gatherer population. The top 10 scores are shown as squares.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_151"></a>It is highly probable that Ireland’s Mesolithic population derived from Britain, with the earliest evidence of permanent settlements on the island dating to approximately 7700 cal BC (Chapple <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). This aligns closely with the seemingly abrupt shift from Early to Late Mesolithic industries in Britain, traditionally marked by the appearance of small scalene triangles (Conneller <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016). In outgroup <span class="italic">F</span><sub class="calibre9">3</sub>-statistics performed for this chapter (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-1">Fig. 11.1</a>), Irish hunter-gatherers share highest levels of drift with two Late Mesolithic samples from south-western Britain dating to <span class="italic">c.</span> 7700–7100 cal BC (Brace <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019). The next highest hits are three samples of a similar time depth from Les Perrats in western France (Brunel <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020) and an Epigravettian genome from Sicily (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018).</p>
<p class="indent">It is unclear whether the shift from Early to Late Mesolithic industries in Britain was accompanied by a substantial influx of new people, although it has been suggested that rising sea levels encouraged Doggerland populations to relocate (Waddington 2007). Here, using a D-statistic of the form D(Outgroup, X; SW_Brit_8800-8000, SW_Brit_7700-7100), I detect no significant gene flow into south-western Britain across this transition. However, the samples that show the highest excess allele sharing (Z=1.3-1.9) with the two Late Mesolithic genomes of this region are contemporaries from Les Perrats and Falkenstein in Baden-Württemberg (Fu <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018), as well as Irish hunter-gatherers. Ongoing gene flow between Britain and the continent during this period would not be unexpected, given the presence of a land bridge and the high residential mobility that seems to have characterised this phase of the European Mesolithic (Crombé and Robinson 2014). However, resolving these relationships requires a larger number of north-western genomes and datasets that are amenable to haplotype-based analyses.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Isolation</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The two Irish hunter-gatherers show the highest level of shared genetic drift seen for all tested pairwise comparisons of European genomes outside of close kin pairs (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020) and similar to that seen for Jōmon hunter-gatherers from Japan (Cooke <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021). Given the difference of approximately 23 human generations between their median radiocarbon values, we can rule out kinship as a cause for this inflation. Instead, as with the Jōmon, we can interpret this as the result of prolonged island isolation. In contrast, the two Late Mesolithic samples from south-western Britain exhibit a much lower level of shared drift and lack detectable differentiation from continental groups (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020), which is likely to be a reflection of geography. Notably, Irish hunter-gatherers have no excess of long runs of homozygosity in their genome compared to other genomes of similar ancestry (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020), implying that despite the island’s impoverished array of flora and fauna, the human population was large enough to sustain outbreeding networks comparable to those found in Britain and the continent. Peter Woodman suggested that the island could sustain a Mesolithic population of 800 to 8000 people or 0.01 to 0.1 person <a id="page_152"></a>per square kilometre (Woodman 1981). The current data support the larger estimate, or an even greater one.</p>
<p class="indent">While the Irish population appears genetically isolated prior to and during the 5th millennium cal BC, it has not yet been established how far back this isolation might have stretched. A relatively immediate founder effect upon colonisation of the island is one possible scenario, but the current data do not preclude a prolonged period of gene flow between the islands. Indeed, the possibly deliberate introduction of wild boar and felines to the island may imply a robust migratory stream (Montgomery <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014) that was not stemmed until later periods. It is also worth reflecting on the transition from the Irish Early to Late Mesolithic during the 7th millennium cal BC and the potential drivers behind the changes in lithics, seemingly unique in Europe, with the exception of the Isle of Man. This transformation may reflect an increasingly insular population, perhaps one experiencing environmental stress (Riede 2009), although any association with the 8.2 kya cooling event remains highly debatable (Warren 2020). It is also possible that this new toolkit represents a secondary colonisation, although potential external sources are lacking. That said, genetic continuity across the transition should not be assumed. An Early Mesolithic genome from Ireland will be required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Connections</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Genomic data are only available from one Mesolithic individual in Britain post-dating the 8th millennium (Brace <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019). This comes from the Cnoc Coig, Oronsay shell midden in the Inner Hebrides (5492±36 BP, calibrated to 4236–3769 cal BC, according to Bownes 2018: SUERC-69249). Intriguingly, a D-statistic of the form D (Outgroup, X; Southwest_British_LM, Irish_HG) produces the highest positive value when X is set as the Cnoc Coig genome. This implies an excess of allele sharing between Cnoc Coig and Irish hunter-gatherers relative to the Late Mesolithic samples from south-west Britain. However, given the very low coverage of the Cnoc Coig genome, the significance of this result is not certain (Z=1.88). It may hint at a connection between Ireland and Scotland at the beginning of the Irish Mesolithic and/or later points in time. The narrow sea crossing between the two regions is one of the more obvious avenues for gene flow between the islands. Unfortunately, the lack of Mesolithic human remains from elsewhere in Britain dating to the end of the period currently prevents further genomic investigation (Meiklejohn <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2011).</p>
<p class="indent">It is worth stressing that while the available data implicate the sea as a strong barrier to migration into Ireland, at least during the Late Mesolithic, it does not preclude all maritime contact. Parallels between Irish and European Mesolithic burial practices, ornaments and lithic technology have been drawn by Graeme Warren (2021), which could suggest low levels of movement, although the busy maritime networks as proposed by Garrow and Sturt (2011) are unlikely. Following a recent Bayesian analysis of radiocarbon dates, Chapple <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2022) have argued for an increase in the Irish population’s size from 5300 cal BC onwards. While sea level rise may have amplified the levels of archaeologically visible activity through time, perceived changes in behaviour are also observed (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> the construction of lake edge platforms). This could suggest an ‘edge effect’, whereby agricultural expansion on the Continent influenced the island in some way (McLaughlin 2020), although even if the population existed in full isolation we would not expect it to remain culturally or technologically static. That said, a Mesolithic date on a cattle bone from Ferriter’s Cove hints <a id="page_153"></a>that some interactions were indeed occurring with continental farmers by the end of the period (Woodman <span class="italic">et al.</span> 1999); see Sheridan and Whittle (this volume) for a discussion of this. However, any new arrivals to the island in the approximately 700 years that separate the two men from Killuragh and Sramore made no detectable genetic impact, as they are symmetrically related to all other ancient populations thus far sampled.</p>
<p class="h">THE IRISH NEOLITHIC</p>
<p class="noindent">There are many outstanding questions regarding the nature of Neolithic migration to Ireland and Britain. One of the most pressing is perhaps the immediate origins of these farmers. How many came, where did they come from, and what subsequent episodes of population growth and restriction occurred as they dispersed over land and sea? Comparison with direct continental source population(s) can also aid in the interpretation of cultural and genetic phenomena within the islands, including interactions with local hunter-gatherers (Thomas 2022). Another set of questions relates to the social structures of these newcomers and their diversification through time. To address some of these issues, I will examine genomic data from the Irish Neolithic (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2016; 2020; Sánchez-Quinto <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019) in the context of recently published studies from France and Britain (Brunel <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Seguin-Orlando <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021; Dulias <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022; Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022; Patterson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). Notably, prior haplotypic analyses, which are sensitive to shallow levels of differentiation, have not been able to differentiate the Irish Neolithic from that of Britain, although clusters associated with Orkney and the developed passage tomb tradition in Ireland have been detected (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Ariano <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). This implies that the islands’ Neolithic populations stemmed from the same or highly similar sources.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Strands</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Several candidate homelands for the Neolithic of Britain and Ireland have been identified along the French coast, from Brittany all the way into the Low Countries. In particular, strong parallels are seen between Chasséo-Michelsberg groups in northern France and the ‘Carinated Bowl Neolithic’ of the islands. Alison Sheridan has argued that the ‘Carinated Bowl Neolithic’ originated in the Nord-Pas de Calais region and is but one of several distinct strands of migration to the islands, albeit the seemingly most extensive one (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Sheridan 2007; 2010; Sheridan and Whittle, this volume). She has also suggested a ‘Breton’ strand into western Britain and Ireland around 4000 cal BC, bringing the practice of constructing megalithic tombs, and a later ‘Trans-Manche Ouest’ strand linking Normandy and south-west England around 3800 cal BC. More recently, Julian Thomas has proposed that a ‘minimal Neolithic’ was initially co-created in the south-east of England by locals and small numbers of migrants, which went on to attract larger streams of migration to the islands from further down the French coast (Thomas 2022). He relates this later movement to the acceleration of Neolithisation after 3900 cal BC as proposed by Whittle <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2011) and to Sheridan’s ‘Trans-Manche Ouest’ strand.</p>
<p class="indent">Previous aDNA work by Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020) reported a potential difference between Irish and British Neolithic populations. The authors suggested a greater affinity between Irish genomes and those from the western French site of Prissé-la-Charrière, relative to <a id="page_154"></a>sites from northern France, which could support the Breton strand hypothesis. However, these tests did not account for potential batch effects. Unlike Ireland, the majority of British data have been produced using SNP capture, a molecular technique designed to enrich for informative sites in the genome (Haak <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2015). While cost-effective, the trade-off is that this targeting can introduce biases (Margaryan <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). When D-statistics are performed using only non-targeted British data, no difference is observed between the two islands with respect to the different French sites (Cassidy 2020; <a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#tab11-1">Table 11.1</a>). This is in agreement with the aforementioned homogeneity of the British-Irish Neolithic population as seen in haplotypic analyses.</p>
<p class="contt" id="tab11-1"><span class="italic">Table 11.1. Select D-statistics for French, Scottish, English and Irish Neolithic populations. The results of the D-statistic D(Mbuti, Pop1; Pop2, Pop3) are shown. Shotgun sequence data (no target enrichment) are used for at least two populations in all tests. A positive value indicates increased allele sharing between Pop1 and Pop3, while negative values indicate increased sharing between Pop1 and Pop2.

<p class="indent"><a id="page_156"></a>Facilitating the co-analysis of datasets generated by different laboratories is of vital importance in future genomic studies of the Neolithic, especially when unpicking differences between closely related groups. Given that capture techniques only target a small fraction of the human genome and can create these confounding effects, future work on British and Irish samples may benefit from focusing on non-targeted approaches when endogenous content is sufficiently high.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Locals</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There are no detectable differences in the level of European hunter-gatherer ancestry between Irish and British Neolithic populations. A rolling average of 18% is seen for both islands over the course of the Neolithic (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-2">Fig. 11.2</a>). That said, admixture between indigenous hunter-gatherers and incoming farmers in Ireland did occur. A male interred at Parknabinnia court tomb is estimated to have had an Irish hunter-gatherer approximately five generations back in his family tree, the only current example of hunter-gatherer input into a megalithic community on the islands (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). This man died <span class="italic">c.</span> 3500 BC, approximately 300 years after the first interments at the neighbouring Poulnabrone portal tomb, suggesting perhaps centuries-long coexistence between locals and migrants in Ireland. Given the invisibility of Late Mesolithic burial practices (Meiklejohn and Woodman 2012), it is possible that these populations persisted on the island for further centuries, whether through voluntary or forced exclusion from farming societies. Notably, the genetic and cultural survival of European hunter-gatherers alongside farmers has been observed in Westphalia (Lipson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2017) and Scandinavia (Skoglund <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014).</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_157"></a>Julian Thomas has suggested the initial Neolithic of south-east England involved substantial local input (Thomas 2022). Indeed, while the Neolithic appears to have arrived in most regions of the islands as a complete ‘package’ (Whittle <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2011), the south-east shows a more staggered uptake. Unfortunately, no ancient genomes from the very first English farmers are available and thus it is not possible to establish the level of admixture with local Mesolithic groups that occurred in these first generations, as later movements may have erased the signature. Moreover, the genetic profile of the continental source population is unknown. French populations appear heterogenous in hunter-gatherer ancestry (Seguin-Orlando <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021), though many have estimates lower than those of Britain and Ireland (Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Here I estimate proportions between 13–16% for three Michelsberg samples from the Paris basin dating to <span class="italic">c.</span> 4000 cal BC. If the unknown source population(s) averaged 14%, a 1:20 ratio of local to migrant input could have produced the 18% average seen in Britain and Ireland, with variability through time and space, as captured in cave sites and a shell midden on the west coast of Scotland (Brace <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019). Notably, only the earlier stages of the British and Irish Neolithic produce individuals with an estimated hunter-gatherer ancestry below 16% (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-2">Fig. 11.2</a>)</p>

<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Size</span></p>
<p class="noindent">While it is clear that the end result of Neolithisation was a swamping of the Mesolithic gene pool, can we put estimates on the number of migrants involved? I attempt this here using IBDNe (Browning and Browning 2015), which considers the length distribution of genomic segments shared between individuals. To reduce temporal differences between samples, I consider two Neolithic populations, one earlier and one later (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-3">Fig. 11.3</a>). Both trajectories suggest some level of a bottleneck <span class="italic">c.</span> 4500 cal BC followed by a rapid expansion, in keeping with expectations. The lowest point estimates of effective population size (Ne) <a id="page_158"></a>during this bottleneck are between 13,000 and 18,000, which, following the formula from Pankratov <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020), may imply a census size of up to 60,000–90,000 people. This suggests a large number of migrants making their way across the Channel. After the bottleneck, Ne then rapidly approaches 1 million and beyond, implying high rates of fertility on the islands. However, these numbers are very preliminary and should be regarded with caution, especially those in the most recent generations, which are most certainly over-estimates. Denser genomic sampling and the application of methods that can take sample age into account are required for confirmation.</p>
<p class="indent">Notably, even the earliest Neolithic individuals from Ireland appear outbred, implying large community sizes (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Recently, Ariano <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2022) estimated an Ne between approximately 2000 and 4000 for the Poulnabrone and Parknabinnia populations, which could indicate a census size of 10,000–20,000 people in the Neolithic Burren (Pankratov <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Estimates of Neolithic population sizes on the islands from other forms of data vary widely, including 120,000 people in Middle Neolithic Britain (Müller 2015) and a boom of perhaps 1 million people in Neolithic Ireland estimated from a summed radiocarbon probability distribution by McLaughlin (2020).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Origins</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Archaeologists differ over the areas from which farming became established in Ireland, although the ‘Carinated Bowl’ strand most probably entered from Britain (Sheridan 2007; 2010; Whittle <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2011). To investigate further, I estimate shared genetic drift between the Irish Neolithic population and samples from other regions using outgroup <span class="italic">F</span><sub class="calibre9">3</sub>-statistics (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-4">Fig. 11.4A</a> and <a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-4">B</a>). Unsurprisingly, the majority of top hits come from Britain, with no clear patterning across that island. On the Continent, the highest scoring genomes cluster together in three regions: north-eastern France, the coast of southern France and the Basque region. To confirm these affinities, continental samples were grouped by geography, time period and cultural associations, and <span class="italic">F</span><sub class="calibre9">3</sub>-statistics were performed once more. This time, the Neolithic populations of England and north-eastern Scotland were also tested, as well as that of Ireland, with no clear differences found in their continental affinities (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-4">Fig. 11.4C</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">The highest average value for the English, Scottish and Irish population is seen for a single individual from a causewayed enclosure at Escalles, a coastal site facing out on to the straits of Dover (Praud 2015; Brunel <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). The sample dates to 4230–3879 cal BC, encompassing the period when the first movements into England are thought to have occurred. In his life, he may even have traversed the Channel. However, the proportion of his ancestry derived from European hunter-gatherers is approximately 23% (<a href="17_Chapter11.xhtml#fig11-2">Fig. 11.2</a>), higher than that seen for any British or Irish Neolithic individual so far tested (14–21%) with the exception of recently admixed outliers. It may be that the Escalles individual is also an outlier in his community or that his population is not the exact progenitor of Britain’s and Ireland’s Neolithic inhabitants. Notably, the site’s pottery shows links with the Spiere Chasséo-Michelsberg group further north in Belgium, while the flint assemblage has affinities to Chasséen flintwork found to the south-west (Praud 2015).</p>

<p class="indent">The Chassey culture emerged <span class="italic">c.</span> 4350 cal BC with apparent origins in the Cardial cultures of southern France (Gernigon 2016). From there, elements spread north through the Loire, Rhône and Seine river valleys. No genomic data are yet available from northern Chassey sites. However, the next highest values seen in this analysis were for a Chassey site on the south coast, Le Pirou, dating to 4447–4251 cal BC (Erl-13040), and for a megalithic tomb from the same region (Brunel <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). These preliminary results may indicate that the Chassey expansion was accompanied by some level of population movement, which eventually culminated in the colonisation of Britain and Ireland. The Chassey was predated in the Paris Basin by the Cerny culture, whose long mounds represent an early manifestation of monumental burial in the region. Two assemblages from the Paris basin dating to the Cerny horizon, Gurgy and Fleury-sur-Orne (Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020), do not produce values as high as Escalles or the southern French sites, but they are still higher than most other populations tested. The same is true of samples from Michelsberg sites <a id="page_160"></a>(Brunel <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020), a culture of north-west and west-central Europe, which is believed to have emerged from the Chassey.</p>
<p class="indent">When considering the origin of the Irish and British Neolithic, it is also worth noting that Y chromosome diversity on the islands is dominated by a specific lineage, I-M284 (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020), that has not yet been identified on the Continent to the author’s knowledge. It is possible that this haplogroup was rare in France and rose to higher frequency due to founder effect upon entry to the islands. Y chromosome lineages can also increase rapidly in frequency due to social prestige inferred on perceived male-line ancestry (Zerjal <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2003). Alternatively, we may find I-M284 at substantial frequencies in a yet unsampled continental progenitor population.</p>
<p class="indent">Taken all together, this author’s best guess is that the major source of Britain’s and Ireland’s Neolithic gene pool will be identified in coastal Chasséo-Michelsberg groups southwest of Escalles. She also suspects that populations further north along the coast, who are in closer proximity to the transitional hunter-gatherer-farmers of Swifterbant culture (Dusseldorp and Amkreutz 2020), may have levels of hunter-gatherer ancestry too high for a large contribution, although this is speculative. And what of the Breton strand? While these results do not preclude a migratory stream from Brittany into Ireland and the west of Britain, it is not detectable in current datasets. If a substantial migration from Brittany did occur, it may have derived from sources too similar to those of more easterly streams to distinguish (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> through a westward expansion of Paris basin populations). Maritime mobility was high at the time of Britain’s and Ireland’s colonisation, evidenced by the rapid diffusion of megalithic architecture along the Atlantic seaboard from north-west France (according to Schulz Paulsson 2019). In this context, the higher affinity of the British and Irish Neolithic individuals to contemporary populations in the Basque region, relative to other Iberians, is intriguing, as archaeological evidence does not suggest any link. The gaping hole in this emerging and intricate picture is genomes from Brittany itself, although the poor preservation of human remains from this region is discouraging (Scarre 2011).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="italic">Society</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The Neolithic populations of Britain and Ireland had a very recent shared origin, vibrant exchange networks and minimal ancestral input from local hunter-gatherer groups. This suggests that, at least for the earlier part of the Neolithic, they would have shared closely related languages, customs and beliefs. Recent studies indicate this included a strong emphasis on the patriline among monumental tomb users (Sánchez-Quinto <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2019; Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Fowler <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022; Rivollat <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). By far the clearest example of this comes from Hazleton North, a chambered long cairn of the Cotswold-Severn group, where a five-generation family tree provided evidence of virilocal burial and female exogamy (Fowler <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). The male progenitor of this pedigree reproduced with four women, whose descendants may have been delegated to different sections of the tomb, hinting at possible polygamous practices. Architectural parallels are seen between Cotswold-Severn tombs, the ‘Clyde’ chambered tombs of south-west Scotland and Irish court tombs, many of which appear to have been built and used over the same short period starting <span class="italic">c.</span> 3700 BC (Schulting <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012). Julian Thomas has suggested that these tombs may have been built <a id="page_161"></a>for the founding generations of specific communities (Thomas 2015; 2022), who perhaps were growing concerned with territory and lineage in an increasingly crowded environment. Notably, Parknabinnia court tomb also shows evidence of patriliny (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). The majority of males belong to a rare Y chromosome lineage, but no close kinship is seen between them. This could reflect patrilineal affiliations between high-status men that stretched back many generations in time.</p>
<p class="indent">Genomes from Irish passage tombs have also shed light on social organisation during the period (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). A network of distant relatives (6th degree or further), spanning a minimum of six centuries, were found interred at three of the major passage tomb complexes – Bru na Bóinne, Carrowkeel and Carrowmore – as well as the related site of Millin Bay. This is best interpreted as an hereditary elite. One of these individuals, a man interred in the right-hand recess of Newgrange, was further found to be the product of first-degree incest. If such unions were socially sanctioned in Neolithic Ireland, then the comparative anthropological data overwhelmingly point to their occurrence within an elite who practised polygyny, patriliny and some degree of political deification (van den Berghe and Mesher 1980; Wolf 2014). The probability of this man’s parentage being unknown or frowned upon by his community and unrelated to both his prestigious interment and his kinship with other passage tomb samples is very low. Thus, it may be useful to compare and contrast the developed passage tomb tradition in Ireland to other cultures that engaged in this custom, bearing in mind criticisms of ethnographic analogy (but see Currie 2016).</p>
<p class="h">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the past decade, new technologies and analytical methods have accelerated the pace of archaeological discovery. One key development has been the emergence of ancient genomics, which has shed new light on prehistoric demography and social organisation. In particular, the flood of genomic data has helped cool down heated, lengthy debates over migration, turning population replacement into a testable hypothesis rather than a subjective interpretation. Burgeoning radiocarbon and isotopic datasets are also allowing regional demographics to be examined at a resolution to which ancient genomics can still only aspire (McLaughlin 2020; Snoeck <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). In Britain and Ireland, this has allowed specialists to revisit major transitions in the archaeological record with fresh eyes (Booth <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021; Cummings <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022; Thomas 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">It goes without saying that the truth underlying the archaeological record is far more complex than any model can account for. The Mesolithic to Neolithic transition in Ireland, like any other event in human history, was not a simple affair. However, as archaeology is a field that thrives on interdisciplinarity, it is sometimes necessary to shirk detail and provide ‘big picture’ narratives to aid in communication, with the implicit understanding that all models are to some extent wrong. My own account of the Neolithisation of Ireland, based on the current genetic data, is then as follows.</p>
<p class="indent">The Irish Late Mesolithic population was isolated, with no evidence for frequent and sustained contact with other regions. Early Neolithic communities were large and adept at seafaring, with the overall population eventually probably reaching hundreds of thousands. <a id="page_162"></a>To a major extent, the population derived from the same source as that relating to British Neolithic individuals, potentially Chasséo-Michelsberg groups on the French coast between Normandy and Nord-Pas de Calais. Assimilation of Irish hunter-gatherers took place and may even have been quite frequent, but ongoing inward migration and high rates of fertility in farming communities kept their genetic contribution minimal. Neolithic societies were hierarchical and preoccupied with male-line descent. By the peak of the developed passage tomb tradition, an hereditary elite had emerged, some of whose members may have been perceived as having divine attributes.</p>
<p class="indent">Further research will surely necessitate small and large adjustments to the above. Going forward, ancient DNA studies must focus on denser sampling of Late Neolithic individuals, not only to place the results from passage tombs into better context, but also to chart the demographic trajectory taken by the Irish population following colonisation, including the ways in which it may have diverged from or dovetailed with that of the neighbouring island. New data from Britain and France are much anticipated. Genomic data from cave sites, including sedimentary DNA, will also be of particular value to our understanding of the lives and legacies of Irish hunter-gatherers. Most importantly, we must continue to grow the vibrant interdisciplinary networks that have made a volume such as this possible.</p>
