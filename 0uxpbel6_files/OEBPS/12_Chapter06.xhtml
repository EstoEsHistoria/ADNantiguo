<p class="chaptitle">Ancient DNA of Near Eastern populations: the knowns and the unknowns</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch6-1"><span class="italic1">Eva Fernández-Domínguez</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">Human archaeogenetics have had a prominent role in the understanding of the biological processes underlying the emergence of agriculture in south-west Asia and the mechanisms involved in their spread into Europe. Genome-wide ancient human DNA data show that a strong genetic substructure existed among the first farming populations of the Fertile Crescent (</span>c. <span class="italic">8000 cal BC). This suggests multiple origins of farming and a local evolution of farmer groups from preceding hunter-gatherer populations with limited gene flow at the onset of the Neolithic. To date, the available Neolithic palaeogenomic data indicate a mainly Anatolian origin for the continental route of the Neolithic expansion, punctuated by local episodes of admixture with local hunter-gatherer groups. According to other lines of evidence, an earlier parallel, sea-mediated expansion from the Levantine and Anatolian coasts cannot be discarded. While ancient DNA has been instrumental in deciphering phenomena of gene-flow among these first farming communities, very little information is available on the social structure and low-scale population movements of these first farmers. Despite recent advances in sampling strategies and genotyping methods, obtaining quality data from ancient Near Eastern samples is still challenging. A multidisciplinary approach including archaeological, anthropological, spatial, chronological and isotopic data could help in filling in the gaps and complementing the still scarce available genomic data.</span></p>
<p class="h">FIRST FARMERS</p>
<p class="noindent">A pivotal change in humankind was the shift from a hunter-gatherer to a farming and herding lifestyle 12,000 years ago. This process, known as the ‘Neolithic transition’, was first initiated by human populations inhabiting a strip of land in south-west Asia known as the ‘Fertile Crescent’, a region extending from the Sinai Peninsula in the south up to the eastern fringe of the Taurus in the north and the Zagros mountains in the east (<a href="12_Chapter06.xhtml#fig6-1">Fig. 6.1</a>). Within this region, three interconnected cultural provinces representing different environmental entities and with different trajectories in the adoption and dispersal of Neolithic practices can be distinguished; the <span class="italic">southern Levant</span> stretches from the Sinai Peninsula up to the Damascus basin, the <span class="italic">northern Levant</span> extends from this point up to the Taurus and Zagros mountains, and the <span class="italic">eastern Fertile Crescent</span> or <span class="italic">Zagros</span> region includes the Zagros mountain-chain and the hilly flanks of western Iran and eastern Iraq. Cyprus is also often included as part of the Levant province due to cultural similarities and chronological synchronicity. While often included as part of the Fertile Crescent, central and western Anatolia represent <a id="page_64"></a>the initial dispersion of the Neolithic rather than its development <span class="italic">in situ</span> (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2013).</p>
<p class="indent">Concomitant with the development of new subsistence practices through the domestication of cereal and animal species were population growth, increase in sedentism and the appearance of the first cities. It is also during this period that characteristic forms of funerary and ritual behaviour became widespread mainly in the western part of the Fertile Crescent, such as the special burial treatment devoted to human skulls, through their modification, plastering or deposition in distinctive places (Bienert 1991). Wall paintings and clay or plaster figurines were other forms of cultural or ritual expression of these first farming societies (Verhoeven 2002). In the Zagros and Anatolia, the emphasis was put on monumentality, with the erection of sculpted pillars and free-standing figures (Asouti 2007). Pottery, one of the main markers of the ‘Neolithic package’ that expanded from the Near East into Europe, appears in the Near East 3000 years after the start of the Neolithic in the 7th millennium cal BC (Price 2000).</p>
<p class="indent">The Neolithic transition in south-west Asia was a slow process that took millennia to complete, built upon the traditions of preceding Late Epipalaeolithic groups (<span class="italic">c</span>. 13–11ky cal BC) who actively and systematically had already started to modify their local environments. The transformations giving rise to the emergence of a productive economy should be therefore understood in the context of changing climatic and environmental conditions at the end of the Pleistocene with the Younger Dryas cold climatic event (<span class="italic">c.</span> 10.8–9.6ky cal BC), followed by temperature and rainfall increase at the start of the Holocene (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2014). In the southern Levant Late Epipalaeolithic Natufian groups had an economy mainly based on foraging but that had already started to experiment and harvest wild cereals. Some of these groups also showed early signs of sedentism, living in partially subterraneous circular structures (pit-houses), and burying their dead inside or next to their houses, a tradition that would continue in the oldest stages of the Neolithic in the region (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1991; Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef 2002; Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2013). In the northern Levant and south-eastern Anatolia sedentary forager groups also start to establish towards the end of the Natufian period (Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef 2002).</p>
<p class="indent">The PPNA (pre-pottery Neolithic A) represents the earliest stage of the Neolithic in south-west Asia during the 9th and first half of the 8th millennium cal BC. While practising crop cultivation, most PPNA communities were still reliant on animal hunting and gathering for survival. These groups were mainly sedentary and, as their predecessors, also inhabited circular semi-subterranean houses. Public buildings with a probable ritual function are also documented in most sites (Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef 2002). In the southern Levant, the PPNA seems to be tightly connected culturally with the Natufian world (Belfer-Cohen and Goring-Morris 2010).</p>
<p class="indent">In the archaeological record, the PPNA phase is succeeded by the pre-pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), which spans from the second half of the 8th to the first half of the 7th millennium cal BC and is subdivided into three or four phases: the Early PPNB, the Middle PPNB, the Late PPNB, and the Final PPNB or PPNC. It is during the PPNB period that agricultural and husbandry practices become the main way of subsistence of human communities. In the whole Fertile Crescent a steep demographic increase is observed during the course of the PPNB, as attested by the emergence of mega-sites or large villages which, in <a id="page_65"></a>some cases, reach 10–14 ha in size, exceeding the dimensions of the largest PPNA/Natufian sites by one order of magnitude (Kadowaki 2012). During the PPNB there is also a change in house architecture and the round, small subterranean PPNA structures are replaced by large square pluricellular houses (Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 2013). Human burials during this period are often found inside or at the porch of the houses, marking a connection between the living and the dead, and human skulls are often given a differential funerary treatment, being deposited (and sometimes accumulated) in distinctive spaces, painted and covered with plaster (Kuijt <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2011). For some scholars, the homogeneity of cultural traits observed across the whole of the Levant and part of Anatolia during this period supports the notion of a PPNB civilisation, <span class="italic">koine</span> or ‘interaction sphere’ (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1989), while others stress the existence of regional differentiation (Asouti 2007).</p>
<p class="indent">Already documented during the PPNA, the PPNB also saw an increase of the complexity of trading networks of goods like obsidian or stone beads, extending throughout the Levant, south-eastern and central Anatolia. The existence of these extensive communication webs would have allowed the exchange of ideas, resources and perhaps also genes among human groups, being instrumental in the success of the Neolithic revolution (Ibáñez <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015). While in some sites of the southern Levant the PPNB gave way to a transitional phase between the aceramic and the ceramic Neolithic, the PPNC, most villages experienced a hiatus in their occupation at the end of the PPNB, a phenomenon known as the ‘PPNB collapse’. Different reasons have been proposed to explain the widespread abandonment of sites during this period: a shift in settlement patterns leading to relocation of human communities, a rapid climate deterioration (8.2ky event), local overexploitation of resources, disease or tensions between neighbouring communities (Bar-Yosef 2001).</p>
<p class="indent">The pre-pottery Neolithic (PPN) period is succeeded by the pottery Neolithic (PN). From this moment onwards there is an emergence of regionally distinct cultural units and pottery starts to be produced. It is at this point during the early 7th millennium cal BC that the ‘Neolithic package’ spreads into Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">Several developments in the techniques of genetic analysis during the mid-1980s led to the emergence of the ancient DNA (aDNA) discipline (Higuchi <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1984). One of the multiple methodological applications within the scope of this plural science is ‘archaeogenetics’ (Renfrew and Boyle 2000). Through the genetic analysis of skeletal elements of humans and animals that lived hundreds or thousands of years ago, this subdiscipline can address fundamental questions on population origins, population admixture and biological relationships within burials or settlements.</p>
<p class="indent">In the following sections of this chapter the knowns and the unknowns in ancient human DNA research in south-west Asia will be presented and discussed. Methodological challenges and limitations of this approach will be highlighted and the state-of-the-art of aDNA research in the first Neolithic Near Eastern communities will be summarised and the evidence revisited in the light of the following research questions:</p>

<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">2.</span> How mobile were these first farmers? Did mobility, gene-exchange and population aggregation play a role in the formation of the first mega-sites?</p>

<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">7.</span> Do the economic, cultural and demographic changes observed in the archaeological record translate into changes of social organisation? Can we investigate these using aDNA?</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">The chapter will conclude with a reflection on what has been achieved so far and, in the opinion of the author, which steps could be taken to gain a more nuanced approach to the study of the world’s first farming societies.</p>
<p class="h">METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES AND RECENT TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis of aDNA from human populations from the early Neolithic in south-west Asia has been hindered by a poor molecular preservation of human remains. Long-term DNA survival in skeletal elements is strongly influenced by environmental conditions during and after deposition such as temperature, pH, humidity or oxygen availability. Among these, the fossil ‘thermal history’, which accounts for both the mean temperature and temperature fluctuations that it has endured up to its analysis, has been demonstrated to have a major effect on DNA degradation through depurination leading to strand fragmentation (Smith <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2003). The warm climate of the Near East, combined sometimes with detrimental post-excavation storage conditions, poses a major difficulty for the recovery of informative DNA fragments. As a result, modern Near Eastern populations have been used as a proxy for early Neolithic groups from the same region until very recently (Richards <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2000; Haak <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2010; Soares <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2010). This approach is, however, problematic, as recent ancient works have shown us that the genetic composition of human populations around the globe has changed substantially in the last five millennia (Haak <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">Three main technological breakthroughs have made it possible to overcome these challenges, at least to some extent, in order to access genetic information from key but climatically challenging areas such as the Near East. The first of these was the development of a new strategy of DNA replication and sequencing, known as ‘Next Generation Sequencing’. In contrast with its technical predecessors PCR and Sanger Sequencing, NGS does not target discrete regions of the genome in independent reactions but allows for the simultaneous recovery of all the existing DNA fragments in the extraction pool. Developed by Margulies <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2005), this technique was used for the first time in the ancient DNA field in 2006 to sequence mammoth DNA and quickly replaced traditional genotyping methods in the study of human aDNA (Poinar <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2006; Sánchez-Quinto <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012). The second game-changer was the development of custom DNA ‘enrichment’ or ‘capture’ strategies that simultaneously select the desired fractions of the genome, substantially bringing down analytical costs. Among these, the ‘1240k capture system’, an in-solution DNA capture panel implemented in 2015 by the Harvard lab (Fu <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013; Haak <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015), has been extensively applied to the study of Neolithic and pre-Neolithic populations. This method allows the simultaneous selection of 1,240,000 neutral positions across the <a id="page_67"></a>human genome that are variable across human populations and its study has shown to be enough to uncover major population substructure and to infer events of past population admixture. The last relevant breakthrough was the discovery that the DNA contained within the <span class="italic">pars petrosa</span> of the skull temporal bone is particularly resilient to long-term environmental degradation, providing between four to 16 times more endogenous aDNA than teeth and between 100 and 200 times more than any other skeletal element (Gamba <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014; Pinhasi <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">In a six-year timespan, the combination of these three technological developments has enabled the unlocking of crucial genomic information from the first farmers of different regions of the Fertile Crescent. <a href="12_Chapter06.xhtml#fig6-1">Figure 6.1</a> shows the location of Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic archaeological sites from the Fertile Crescent and Anatolia that have provided genetic information so far. As can be appreciated in the figure, the chronological and geographical representation is still scarce and patchy, and key regions within the northern Levant such as the middle Euphrates valley are almost unexplored.</p>

<p class="h"><a id="page_68"></a>THE LAST HUNTER-GATHERERS AND THE FIRST FARMERS OF SOUTH-WEST ASIA</p>
<p class="noindent">As detailed above, before the transition to farming, south-west Asia was populated by local Epipalaeolithic groups with a predominantly hunter-gatherer economy. While the available archaeological evidence points towards a gradual adoption of a production economy by some of these groups, the roles of human mobility and gene-flow in the emergence of agriculture have been a matter of discussion among scholars for decades.</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, different ancient DNA works have addressed this issue, focusing on the genetic analysis of the last hunter-gatherers and the first farmers of the main domestication centres: the southern Levant (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; 2022a; Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019), the northern Levant/Upper Mesopotamia (Fernández <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a) and the Zagros region (Broushaki <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; Gallego-Llorente <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; Narasimhan <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Allentoft <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a), alongside secondary areas of Neolithisation such as central/western Anatolia (Kılınç <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a) and Cyprus (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a). The pre-Neolithic genetic background (whole genome data and/or mitochondrial DNA) is represented by just 11 individuals: eight Natufians from Raqefet cave in Israel, two Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers from Belt cave and Hotu Cave in Iran and one from Pinarbaşi in central Anatolia. In the southern Levant, the Neolithic background is represented by 16 individuals: 14 from Jordan from the PPNB and PPNC levels of ‘Ain Ghazal (n=13) and the Late PPNB in Baja (n=1) and two from the PPNB levels from Kfar HaHoresh and Motza in Israel. In northern Mesopotamia, so far just three individuals belonging to the PPNB period have provided whole-genome data, one from Bonçuklu Tarla in south-eastern Turkey and two from Nemrik 9 in northern Iraq, but mitochondrial DNA data from 15 individuals are also available from the Middle PPNB levels of Tell Halula and Tell Ramad in modern Syria. The pre-pottery Neolithic of the eastern Fertile Crescent is represented by 10 individuals from Ganj Dareh, three from Tepe Abdul Hossein, one from Wehmet Cave and three from Tepe Guran in the central Zagros in Iran, and four from Bestansur (8000–7000 cal BC) and three from Shanidar cave (<span class="italic">c</span>. 8300–7900 cal BC) in the northern Zagros region of Iraq. Outside of the Fertile Crescent in central Anatolia genetic data from the first farmers are available from 17 PPNB individuals, nine from Bonçuklu and eight from Aşıklı Höyuk. In Cyprus, genetic profiles have been obtained from three PPNB individuals from Kissonerga-Mylouthkia. Dates and site locations can be found in <a href="12_Chapter06.xhtml#fig6-1">Figure 6.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Whole-genome data of the first Near Eastern farmers show a profound regional genetic structure and overall genetic continuity with preceding Epipalaeolithic groups, which account for 75–90% of their respective ancestries. Three main genetic clusters can be distinguished across the region. In the southern Levant, a <span class="italic">Levantine ancestral component</span> is maximised in Natufian groups and early (PPNB) Neolithic farmers from Jordan and Israel. Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers and early farmers from the eastern Fertile Crescent show a distinct, divergent <span class="italic">Iranian genetic profile</span>, which is also maximised in Caucasus hunter-gatherers. Similarly, Anatolian pre-ceramic farmers derive most of their ancestry from the Pinarbaşi Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherer. In sum, all these findings support the idea that the development of agriculture was driven by genetically different hunter-gatherer groups that inhabited the Levant, the Zagros and Anatolia and shared technological innovations (see references above, and Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021 for a synthesis).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_69"></a>The three northern Mesopotamian PPNB individuals from the upper Tigris cluster closer to the individuals from the Zagros, indicating the presence of a high proportion of Iranian-like ancestry in them. Their ancestry profiles can be modelled, however, as a mixture of Iranian and Anatolian-like ancestries (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022a). The lack of pre-Neolithic genetic data from this region prevents making inferences regarding the origins of this ancestry profile and specifically, whether it was already present in preceding Natufian/ Epipalaeolithic groups or originated in a different region of the Fertile Crescent.</p>
<p class="indent">Archaeological evidence supports an exogenous origin rather than a local development of the Neolithic in Cyprus. Evidence for the pre-Neolithic occupation of Cyprus is scarce and limited to a few enclaves that show no obvious continuity with the well-documented and widespread pre-ceramic sites. The first Neolithic settlements in Cyprus, Asprokremnos and Klimonas, date to the PPNA and are contemporaneous to Late PPNA and PPNA– PPNB transition sites in the Levant. Direct parallels in architecture and material culture have been drawn between these early Neolithic sites in Cyprus and some sites in the Middle Euphrates, which suggests that the island was most likely colonised by groups of pre-ceramic farmers from the northern Levant (Vigne <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2009). The available genetic data from Neolithic Cyprus are restricted to three individuals found in commingled contexts in the PPNB site of Kissonerga-Mylouthkia and show a predominantly Anatolian-related ancestry, suggestive of an Anatolian origin. The depositional context of these individuals is, however, rather unusual, as instead of being formally buried, they were placed in water wells close to the sea. This atypical mortuary practice raises the question of whether these individuals are representative of the general PPNB population in Cyprus, or constitute an outlier (Peltenburg 2003; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022b).</p>
<p class="h">GENE-FLOW AMONG FIRST FARMERS</p>
<p class="noindent">A detailed analysis of the genomic structure of these first farming populations revealed that despite deriving most of their ancestry from their hunter-gatherer predecessors, they also received variable levels of gene-flow from neighbouring groups.</p>
<p class="indent">PPNB populations from the southern Levant derive part of their ancestry (25%) from Anatolian-like farming populations. This ‘excess’ of Anatolian ancestry is not present in the Natufian group, which suggests that it was acquired through admixture at the first stages of development of the Neolithic (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; 2022a; Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019). While the ancestry profiles of PPNB farmers from central Anatolia (Bonçuklu and Aşıklı Höyük) show that they mainly descend from local Epipalaeolithic individuals, different levels of additional ‘Iranian’ and ‘Levantine-like’ ancestries have also been detected, indicating that they received additional gene-flow from a population or populations carrying these ancestries around the time of the adoption of agriculture (Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a). These two population groups can be effectively modelled as a mixture of the local Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherer (Pinarbaşi) and Mesopotamian PPNB individuals, which supports the hypothesis that the ‘donor population’ could have been the Mesopotamian group itself or a close population with a similar genetic profile (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_70"></a>Later Anatolian populations belonging to the Ceramic horizon display 6 to 23% extra Levantine ancestry, which indicates post-PPNB gene-flow into Anatolia (Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a). This ancestry could be traced back to southern Levantine-like populations or could have also been introduced by other unsampled Levantine populations, for example from the middle Euphrates region, from which whole genome data have not been recovered yet (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a).</p>
<p class="indent">It is not until the Chalcolithic/Late Neolithic period (<span class="italic">c.</span> 6ky cal BC) that this genetic differentiation observed among first farmer groups of south-west Asia starts to decrease as a result of increased gene-flow among populations (Skourtanioti <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022b). During this period a genetic gradient of decreasing Anatolian ancestry and increasing Iran/Caucasus ancestry can be observed between western Anatolia to the Caucasus and Iran. This cline, indicative of extensive population admixture across these regions, is maintained throughout the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age. In contrast, populations of the northern Levant experienced a post-Neolithic increase of south-Levantine and Iran/Caucasus related ancestries, through multiple gene-flow events from different sources or, alternatively, from northern Mesopotamia (Skourtanioti <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020).</p>
<p class="h">POPULATION SOURCES OF THE EUROPEAN NEOLITHIC</p>
<p class="noindent">From the Near East the Neolithic spread into Europe around the 7th millennium cal BC, reaching first the Aegean coast and then diffusing across continental and Mediterranean Europe. Multiple ancient DNA studies have shown that early farmers across Europe carry ancestry from north-western Anatolian Pottery Neolithic populations, thus supporting the view that the Neolithic diffusion was mediated by ceramic farming groups of Anatolian origin. The same ancestry source is present, albeit in different proportions, in early farming groups from the Balkans (Gamba <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014; Haak <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015a; Hervella <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; Szécsényi-Nagy <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018), central Europe (Brandt <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013; Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014; Haak <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015), Scandinavia (Mittnik <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018), southern France and Iberia (Olalde <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; 2019; Rivollat <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020) and Britain (Brace <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019). As these first farmers moved around the landscape, they also interacted with local hunter-gatherer populations in different regions, creating different genetic profiles in different parts of Europe (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018; Rivollat <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020; Allentoft <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">However, a few individuals that are not consistent with descending from the same source population as other European farmers have also been reported: four from Diros and Franchthi Cave in the Greek Peloponnese (<span class="italic">c.</span> 4000 cal BC), one from Krepost in Bulgaria (5718–5626 cal BC) belonging to the Karanovo Neolithic cultural complex (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018), and 10 early Neolithic individuals from central Italy from Grotta Continenza and Ripabianca di Monterado (<span class="italic">c.</span> 6000–5000 cal BC) (Antonio <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019). In addition to ancestry from north-west Anatolian farmers, these individuals carry an excess of ‘Iranian ancestry’, suggesting that they descend from a different source population than other early Neolithic individuals in Europe. The earliest described sources with this ancestry profile in the Near East can be found in Anatolian Ceramic sites such as <a id="page_71"></a>Tepeçik Çiftik and Kumtepe (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018), but origins in unsampled regions from northern Levant cannot be discarded. While the exact origin of this ancestry is still unknown, these results constitute direct evidence that more than one population source was involved in the spread of the Neolithic from south-west Asia into Europe. Similarities in mitochondrial DNA haplotype and haplogroup composition between <span class="italic">c.</span> 8000 cal BC farmers from the middle Euphrates valley and the Damascus basin in the northern Levant and modern Cyprus have also suggested an early colonisation of the island by PPNB farmers from the Levant, in agreement with archaeological evidence (Fernández <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014). While the only whole-genome PPN data from Cyprus available to date indicate an Anatolian origin of the tested individuals, as pointed out before the particularities of their burial arrangement cast doubts on their representativity for the whole PPNB horizon in the island (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022a).</p>
<p class="indent">To understand the extent to which Near Eastern populations other than Anatolia contributed to the genetic pool of the first farmers, it would be essential to examine genome-wide data of early Neolithic individuals from the Aegean and the Adriatic. In the case of Cyprus, the genetic analysis of individuals from archaeological sites with clear archaeological parallels with Levantine pre-pottery groups will be key to fully assessing the origins of the first farmers that colonised the island.</p>
<p class="h">ANCIENT DNA AND SOCIAL ORGANISATION OF THE FIRST FARMING COMMUNITIES</p>
<p class="noindent">The transition from a forager to a productive economy alongside the increase in sedentism and the emergence of the first cities in south-west Asia was accompanied by a major restructuring of social roles in early Neolithic groups. As individual workloads increased, so did competition for land-access and resources. Living in permanent structures in densely occupied settlements would have added to these tensions.</p>
<p class="indent">Traditionally, the study of societal changes associated with the adoption of agriculture has been approached through the analysis of settlement architecture, material culture and mortuary practices, drawing occasional ethnographic parallels with modern hunter-gatherer or farming societies. Comparatively, less emphasis has been devoted to the direct analysis of the skeletal remains. A key question is the role played by biological kin in the organisation of these first farming societies and how and if it was reflected in their funerary practices. Across the PPNA, PPNB and Pottery Neolithic periods in most of the Levant and Anatolia individuals were buried beneath the floor of the houses while they were still in use, providing a link between the living and the dead. Houses were often rebuilt, and new buildings placed above the old ones. By examining the role of kin in these societies an answer can be provided to questions such as:</p>
<div class="num3">
<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">1.</span> Were these groups endogamic and, to what extent?</p>
<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">2.</span> Were societies articulated around nuclear, extended families or unrelated cooperative groups?</p>
<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">3.</span> Were houses inhabited by families or non-family related individuals?</p>
<p class="numa"><a id="page_72"></a><span class="numa1">4.</span> Were the inhabitants of different rebuilt levels of the same house biologically connected?</p>
<p class="numa"><span class="numa1">5.</span> What was the relationship between intra-mural burials and those in public structures?</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">The analysis of dental and skeletal epigenetic traits suggests that both endogamic (Alt <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013) and exogamic (Alt <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015) mating systems might have been common among certain early farming communities, but the evidence is limited to just a few sites. The study of isotopes of diet (C, N) and mobility (Sr, O) in Neolithic and pre-Neolithic groups has also a great potential to identify dietary differences within the same household and evaluate intra- and inter-site individual mobility to detect differences in mobility patterns, but the available data from the Near East are still very limited (Pearson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; 2021; Santana <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021).</p>
<p class="indent">The refinement of methods of estimation of biological relatedness or kinship from low-coverage human genomes offers a unique opportunity to approach these questions empirically (Kuhn and Jakobsson 2015; Fernandes <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021). To date, the data are limited to three studies and five archaeological sites, but this is expected to increase in the following years. The first attempt to reconstruct family relationships among first farming communities focused on the mtDNA analysis of individuals from intra-mural house contexts in the Middle PPNB site of Tell Halula, Syria. Shared mitochondrial haplotypes were identified both among different rebuilt phases of the same house and across neighbouring houses from the same and different archaeological phases. These results suggest a homogeneous population structure, but the study has a limited resolution, as only short mitochondrial DNA fragments could be recovered with the techniques available at the time (Fernández <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2008).</p>
<p class="indent">A similar approach using full genomes alongside uniparental markers was employed (Chyleński <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Yaka <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021) to decipher biological kinship patterns in two 9th-millennium PPNB central Anatolian sites, Bonçuklu and Aşıklı Höyük and three PN sites from the 8th–6th millennia cal BC in central (Çatalhöyük and Tepecik-Çiftlik) and northwestern Anatolia (Barcın Höyük). The majority of individuals that provided usable genetic data in the pre-ceramic sites (nine in Bonçuklu and five in Aşıklı Höyük) had relatives within the same house or in neighbouring houses, but others were not biologically related to analysed members of the same house. In the two ceramic sites, genetic data could be obtained mostly from non-adult individuals (14 in Çatalhöyük, 23 in Barcın Höyük and five in Tepecik-Çiftlik). Contrary to their predecessor PPNB groups, the presence of relatives within co-burials and neighbouring buildings in these sites was rare. In Çatalhöyük and Tepecik-Çiftlik only one pair of first-degree relatives were found within the same building, while in Barcın two pairs of related individuals were found in separate houses in close proximity. Overall, these results support the notion that at the early stages of the Neolithic in Anatolia genetic relatedness played a role in household composition. Later ceramic households, however, do not seem to be organised around biological kinship according to the gathered data. The limited biomolecular preservation of the human remains, which allowed for the recovery of genetic information of just 20% of the sampled individuals and the differential biomolecular preservation of adults and subadults, prevents us from drawing more general conclusions about the funerary practices of these groups and by extension, about aspects of their social organisation.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="page_73"></a>THE UNKNOWNS AND MOVING FORWARD</p>
<p class="noindent">As detailed in the previous sections, the analysis of ancient DNA from Near Eastern populations has helped to clarify essential questions on the emergence and dispersal of agriculture in the region by clarifying the biological relationship between farmers and foragers, identifying major gene-flow events from different population groups, pinpointing the source(s) of origin of the Neolithic spread in Europe and investigating the role of biological kinship in the social organisation of the first farming societies.</p>
<p class="indent">The poor preservation of human remains in the area and the difficulty to access, export and study material in ‘politically sensitive’ areas has greatly limited the resolution of some of these studies. For example, the inference of population admixture relies on the availability of high-quality coverage genomes to act as proxies of population groups carrying a particular genetic signature. While current methods are sufficient to distinguish between the main ‘ancestry components’ of a given past population, the population sources, timings and processes that gave rise to a particular genetic profile are still difficult to ascertain without a good chronological and geographical representation of the data. In the case of the Fertile Crescent, an obvious gap is the lack of genomic information of Epipalaeolithic/ Natufian and PPN individuals from the northern Levant, a key region in the emergence, consolidation and spread of agricultural practices.</p>
<p class="indent">Except for Anatolia, where data from Epipalaeolithic, Pre-ceramic and Ceramic sites are available from a handful of locations, ancient DNA from chronological transects spanning the transition to agriculture is not yet available for south-west Asia. This information is essential to answer questions of genetic continuity and gene-flow at a regional scale. The transition to the PPN to the PN in the Levant and the eastern Fertile Crescent and the population implications of the ‘PPNB collapse’ are other unknowns that will only be able to be resolved through dense sampling across different archaeological phases of the same site or region.</p>
<p class="indent">Apart from the difficulties associated with the access to samples and the technical limitations in the recovery of Neolithic Near Eastern aDNA, there are other reasons that could be holding back the advancement in the knowledge of the genetic composition of the first Near Eastern farmers. On one hand, there is a generalised lack of transparency in sample processing and back-up sample storage in ancient DNA laboratories. Genetic data outputs are stored in public repositories such as Genbank (Clark <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016) or ENA (European Nucleotide Archive) (Leinonen <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2011) and are freely available to download. Negative and sample screening results below the threshold for analysis, however, are often not disclosed. In a similar way, once skeletal samples are processed, most labs retain remains for safety or future analysis. A simple initiative such as the public disclosure of all the studied samples and DNA screening results would be very effective to avoid resampling, boost collaboration, inform sampling strategies and better understand differential preservation across sites and regions in the Near East. On the other hand, engagement with other disciplines is still limited. In a region that has proven particularly harsh for DNA preservation, a multidisciplinary approach including archaeological, anthropological, spatial, chronological and isotopic data could help in filling in the gaps and complementing the still scarce available genomic data.</p>
