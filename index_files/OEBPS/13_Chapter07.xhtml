<p class="chaptitle">Farmer-forager interactions in the Iron Gates: new insights and new dilemmas</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch7-1"><span class="italic1">Maxime N. Brami and Yoan Diekmann</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">Early farmers in Europe are known to have migrated from Anatolia and the Aegean basin. The latest ancient DNA and archaeological studies indicate that there were significant biological and cultural interactions between the Neolithic incomers and indigenous Mesolithic communities, including adoption of local subsistence and burial practices by migrant farmers and their offspring in places like the Danube’s Iron Gates. However, the evidence for foragers becoming farmers is more equivocal, hinging on the interpretation of a handful of archaeological sites including Lepenski Vir.</span></p>
<p class="h">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="noindent">Ancient DNA (hereafter aDNA) has been used to create new narratives about the movement and mixtures of peoples during the Neolithic at varying scales (Furholt 2021). A well-founded concern is that prehistory is being hastily rewritten as a deep history of mass migrations, with ‘pots’ and ‘people’ inextricably linked together, as was the case in the heyday of culture-historical archaeology (Heyd 2017). Some aDNA studies have nonetheless begun to explore more detailed relationships at the smaller scale of particular contexts, such as individual graves and cemeteries (for Neolithic Anatolia and south-east Europe, see for example, de Becdelièvre <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020; Yaka <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021; Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). Here we illustrate how aDNA can be used at the individual site level, together with the archaeology, to generate new ideas and promote new dialogues about a region of enormous importance for our understanding of the European Neolithic.</p>
<p class="indent">Lepenski Vir is widely examined as part of the Iron Gates Mesolithic–Neolithic transition but has also received an unusual amount of attention as an individual settlement site (see Borić 2016; Bonsall and Boroneanţ 2018 for recent overviews of the archaeological record). It is currently the only site in inland Europe with credible support for an <span class="italic">in situ</span> transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic lifeways (Shennan 2018). Elsewhere, agriculture and related innovations, such as pottery and early village societies, are thought to have been introduced fully-fledged by migrant farmers, who derived almost all of their ancestry from populations established in Anatolia and the Aegean basin (hereafter described as ‘Aegeans’) since at least the 7th millennium cal BC (Hofmanová <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; Kılınç <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018; Feldman <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019; Marchi <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). Evidence for interaction between farmers and foragers during the early Neolithic period in inland Europe is similarly limited to a <a id="page_80"></a>handful of sites, which show either a tiny Mesolithic contribution to the local Neolithic gene pool (Lipson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2017; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2018; Nikitin <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019) or intriguing patterns of parallel occupation without an outright shift in food production (Bollongino <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013).</p>
<p class="indent">Long viewed as an atypical Mesolithic site, Lepenski Vir has, in recent years, produced compelling evidence for genetic and cultural interactions between foragers and Aegean first farmers (Hofmanová 2017; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018; Borić 2019; Hofmanová <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022; Marchi <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). To date, patterns of hybridity observed at the site have been primarily explained as Neolithic women marrying into a Mesolithic group (Borić and Price 2013), a scenario that does not sit well with the genetic evidence (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022; Hofmanová <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). This article revisits evidence for interaction between early farmers and foragers in the Iron Gates, during the so-called ‘Mesolithic–Neolithic transition’ phase of Lepenski Vir, demonstrating how aDNA alters the interpretation of these interactions to a far greater extent than currently accepted in the literature.</p>
<p class="h">NEOLITHIC DISPERSALS AND THE IRON GATES MESOLITHIC</p>
<p class="noindent">Ever since Gordon Childe’s <span class="italic">Danube in Prehistory</span> (Childe 1929), the Neolithic expansion in inland Europe has been primarily regarded as a ‘riverine’ phenomenon (Whittle and Bickle 2014 and references therein). The distribution of the first farming communities in southeast Europe generally follows fertile river valleys and watercourses, the Danube being the most significant European highway. Given their geographical situation, the Iron Gates – referring to the 134 km-long stretch of the Danube that connects the central European Pannonian basin with the Wallachian steppes, today’s border between Serbia and Romania – appear to have been an important gateway for farming dispersals (<a href="13_Chapter07.xhtml#fig7-1">Fig. 7.1</a>). Lined by high mountains on both sides, there was limited hinterland for cereal agriculture and the main way through the gorge was via the river.</p>
<p class="indent">A remarkable Mesolithic/Neolithic phenomenon flourished in this environment, with over 450 burials containing the remains of over 700 individuals recovered at over 50 caves and open-air sites, including Lepenski Vir, Padina, Schela Cladovei and Vlasac (Bonsall and Boroneanţ 2018). Iron Gates foraging communities appear to have taken advantage of seasonal fish migrations from the Black Sea to settle down, on a semi-permanent basis, on the banks of the river, from <span class="italic">c</span>. 7600 cal BC onwards (Bonsall 2008). Stable isotope studies conducted since the mid-1990s on skeletons from the Iron Gates indicate a shift from aquatic to mixed aquatic/terrestrial (plant- or animal-based) food webs in some humans buried at Lepenski Vir and other Iron Gates sites starting <span class="italic">c</span>. 6200 cal BC (Bonsall <span class="italic">et al</span>. 1997).</p>
<p class="indent">The early change in human isotopic signatures is puzzling, given the absence of domesticates in the Iron Gates before <span class="italic">c</span>. 5900 cal BC (sheep/goat, cattle and pig) (Borić and Dimitrijević 2007). While isotopic changes may simply reflect different foraging practices, the most parsimonious explanation for this shift is that individuals with a terrestrial diet were raised as farmers outside the gorge, as indicated by their ‘non-local’ strontium isotope signature (Borić and Price 2013). Alternatively, cereals could have been obtained from communities outside the gorge. Small-scale plant and/or animal husbandry in the hillsides and adjoining valleys remains theoretically possible.</p>

<p class="h">NEOLITHIC WOMEN JOINING A MESOLITHIC VILLAGE? MODELLING SEX, SOCIETY AND AGRICULTURE AT LEPENSKI VIR</p>
<p class="noindent">First used as a burial location in the 10th millennium cal BC, Lepenski Vir was re-settled <span class="italic">c</span>. 6200 cal BC after a hiatus of several hundred years, at the time of the arrival of agriculture in the central Balkans (Krauß <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018; Porčić <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020). At the peak of occupation, during the ‘Mesolithic–Neolithic transition’ phase (Borić 2016), <span class="italic">c</span>. 6200–5900 cal BC, clusters of elaborate houses with trapezoidal red limestone floors were built according to an apparently predetermined plan on the banks of the Danube and lower terraces of the Koršo mountain. Adults, children and neonates were buried both inside and outside these houses, often in extended supine position, as described by Dušan Borić (2016) in his <span class="italic">Deathways at Lepenski Vir</span>. Spectacular stone carvings in the form of human heads with fish-like features found deposited on floors of abandoned houses date to this period.</p>
<p class="indent">While few today would describe the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition at Lepenski Vir as autochthonous, the assumption remains that the site began life as a Mesolithic fishing village, which later adopted aspects of Neolithic lifeways through interaction with farming communities outside the Iron Gates gorge. A scenario involving Neolithic women marrying <a id="page_82"></a>into a Mesolithic community was first outlined in 2013, somewhat cautiously, as a way to explain the arrival of isotopically ‘non-local’ individuals at the site (Borić and Price 2013). The anthropological sexing information on which this premise was based has since been genetically revisited (Hofmanová <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022):</p>
<div class="quote">
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Of 10 nonlocal individuals […] at Lepenski Vir, all but one burial […] are females or possible females. This pattern could be interpreted as suggesting a reciprocal mating network between the Danube Gorges foragers and the earliest farming communities in the surrounding areas (Bori</span>ć <span class="italic">and Price 2013, 3302).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Following the publication of four genomes from Lepenski Vir in 2018 (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018), three of which (two adult females and one child) showed significant Aegean ancestry proportions (&gt;90%), a broader claim was made regarding ‘women and material goods’ being exchanged and ‘trigger[ing] the burst of cultural and symbolic creativity found at Lepenski Vir’ (Borić <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018, 11).</p>
<p class="indent">Although sweeping changes at Lepenski Vir, including the abandonment of the trapezoidal houses, suggest that farmers subsequently dominated (<span class="italic">c</span>. 5900–5500 cal BC), farmers and foragers are considered to have lived together harmoniously during the transitional period (<span class="italic">c</span>. 6200–5900 cal BC). Much depends on the interpretation of Lepenski Vir as a settled fishing village welcoming a few non-natives, who were integrated into existing ‘patrilocal’ mating networks. However, the abrupt construction of the village at Lepenski Vir after a long hiatus, <span class="italic">c</span>. 6200 cal BC, has long raised questions about the Mesolithic background of the Neolithic occupation (Borić 2007). Although this scenario is compelling, does it withstand detailed scrutiny?</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming that Neolithic women joined an established Mesolithic community, and that their arrival initiated the process of Neolithic transition at Lepenski Vir, one would expect the following to be true:</p>
<div class="num3">
<p class="bull"><span class="bull1">•</span> Predominance of females among incomers (consequently, admixture was sex-biased, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> predominantly male foragers mated with female farmers)</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull1">•</span> Dominance of the forager culture at the site</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="bull1">•</span> Adoption of farming practices by foragers.</p>
</div>
<p class="h">MIGRANT FEMALES OR MIGRANT FAMILIES?</p>
<p class="noindent">Ancient DNA analyses have now offered fresh perspectives on these questions, adding further dimensions that interact with, enrich and unsettle long-standing archaeological interpretations of Lepenski Vir as a Mesolithic village in the process of transition to agriculture. Genomic and mitochondrial sequences from 96 Iron Gates Mesolithic/ Neolithic individuals, including 34 at Lepenski Vir alone, provide unprecedented insights into this region’s complex population history, indicating that two populations lived side by side and sporadically admixed at places like Lepenski Vir (González-Fortes <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017; Hofmanová 2017; Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018; Hofmanová <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022; Marchi <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">Local Iron Gates hunter-gatherers (hereafter ‘Iron Gates HGs’) were joined around 6200 cal BC by people who traced their ancestry back to Anatolia and the Aegean <a id="page_83"></a>Basin. Indeed, some of the individuals identified genetically as Aegeans (Lepenski Vir, Burials 82, 122) have produced δ<sup class="calibre8">15</sup>N values (respectively 11.2‰ and 9.5‰: Borić and Price 2013; Jovanović <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019) that are consistent with a mixed or terrestrial C<sub class="calibre9">3</sub> plant food diet. New research indicates that newcomers were men, women and children born to immigrant parents. Among those individuals that show no admixture with Iron Gates HGs in a two-population qpAdm model (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022), four are genetically male (Lepenski Vir Burials 61, 73, 82, 122) and two are female (Burials 17, 54e).</p>
<p class="indent">With regard to the Aegean males, at least one is definitely associated with the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition phase at Lepenski Vir. This is Burial 122, consisting of the stray skull without a mandible of an adolescent (15–18 years old), deposited in between the superimposed floors of trapezoidal houses 47 and 47’, at the centre of the settlement (Marchi <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). Burial 61 provides another interesting case. This child, <span class="italic">c</span>. 8 years old, genetically male, has been reported in the literature as ‘admixed’, with a Y haplogroup (R1b) hinting at an Iron Gates hunter-gatherer contribution on the male side (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018). Yet over 90% of his ancestry derives from the Aegean gene pool. This new evidence suggests that Aegean families settled at Lepenski Vir and raised their children there, occasionally admixing with Iron Gates HGs, who were also buried at the site (Burial 91).</p>
<p class="indent">Ancestry proportion estimates on the X chromosome and the autosomes for published Balkan Neolithic individuals indicate no sex-specific patterns (Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018, 201) and thus do not rule out a near-equal ratio of males and females from hunter-gatherer and farmer populations engaged in mating. At Lepenski Vir, likewise, admixture patterns are not consistent with exclusively Iron Gates HG males mating with Aegean females or exclusively Aegean males with Iron Gates HG females (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022).</p>
<p class="h">LOCAL FISHERFOLK PREFERENTIALLY BURIED AT THE PERIPHERY OF THE VILLAGE?</p>
<p class="noindent">Lepenski Vir is one of the oldest settlements in inland Europe with elaborate residential architecture and complex sequences of human burials. Almost the entire surface area of the prehistoric site (<span class="italic">c</span>. 2500 m<sup class="calibre8">2</sup>) was excavated from 1965 to 1970 by Dragoslav Srejović, in advance of the construction of the Đerdap I dam, allowing for detailed spatial analysis of the distribution of the burials across the settlement and beyond, in what has been described as a ‘cemetery’ on the western edge of the village (Srejović 1972, 140–1). Interestingly, Aegean incomers and their descendants, such as those discovered in Burials 122, 54e and 61 (respectively carrying K, J and H haplogroups), were closely associated with sequences of trapezoidal houses. Some Aegeans were also found as disarticulated remains outside or in between houses (Burial 82).</p>
<p class="indent">By contrast, individuals genetically closest to Iron Gates HGs (Burials 91, 27a, 27d) were all buried outside the space of habitation in large multi-inhumation pits during the transitional phase (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). These stacked burials, located just outside the horseshoe-shaped settlement ‘shelf’ identified by Srejović (1972), mainly in the upper terrace overlooking the site, have long been identified as an unusual feature of the Lepenski Vir occupation (see Radovanović 2000; Borić 2016). Borić (2016, 189–200), who devotes a separate section of <a id="page_84"></a>his book to ‘primary burials outside of trapezoidal buildings and in pits’, described these features as ‘point[ing] to a preference for peripheral parts of the settlement [… I]n three locations successive burials were recorded in the same place, with significant damage made to older primary inhumations through the interment of new burials or practices of secondary exhumation and manipulation of skeletal elements from primary burials’.</p>
<p class="indent">Mitochondrial information available for 20 individuals from the transitional phase indicates that those carrying U5 haplogroups were, with one exception, all buried some distance away from trapezoidal houses in the upslope area at the rear of the village (<a href="13_Chapter07.xhtml#fig7-2">Fig. 7.2</a>). U5 is generally seen as a marker for European hunter-gatherers before the arrival of the first farmers (Bramanti <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2009). Indeed, only one of 96 individuals from Anatolia and the Aegean Basin (<span class="italic">c</span>. 9500–5500 cal BC) has produced a U5 mitochondrial haplogroup (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022, Electronic Supplementary Material), whereas most European hunter-gatherers belong to the U5 clade (Lazaridis <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2014).</p>
<p class="indent">In the same period, Aegean incomers and Iron Gates HGs thus appear to have buried their dead largely separately, suggesting differences in status between the two groups or cultural practices linked to ethnic identity. Intriguingly, some of the incomers (Burials 54e, 61) were buried like the locals in extended supine position parallel to the Danube with the head pointing downstream (Borić 2016). Distinctive burial practices between the two groups thus do not perfectly match the genetic evidence. This ‘mosaic’ pattern in burial traditions (de Becdelièvre <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020), which could be described as syncretic behaviour, may not necessarily indicate assimilation of Aegeans into a ‘dominant’ Mesolithic society (<span class="italic">contra</span> Borić 2019, 43). Cultural hybridity rarely reflects a single identity (Hayden 2002, 215). Competitive interactions between the two groups are just as likely to have led to elements of the Mesolithic culture being adopted and transformed by Neolithic incomers. The latter did not merely introduce agriculture at Lepenski Vir but also appear to be the main inhabitants of the settlement with houses. Later in the sequence, <span class="italic">c</span>. 5900 cal BC, all burials were in contracted position on one side, as was customary among early Neolithic societies in Anatolia and south-east Europe (Brami 2017).</p>
<p class="image" id="fig7-2"><img alt="images" src="images/f0084-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 7.2. Spatial distribution of previously reported Lepenski Vir burials sampled for aDNA analysis during the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition phase (</span>c. <span class="italic">6200–5900 cal BC). Trapezoidal house floors are indicated. Most of the individuals with a U5 mitochondrial haplogroup,</span> i.e. <span class="italic">typical of European hunter-gatherers, are buried outside the space of habitation in large multi-inhumation pits.</span></p>
<p class="h"><a id="page_85"></a>FARMERS ADOPTING FORAGING PRACTICES, BUT FORAGERS NOT BECOMING FARMERS?</p>
<p class="noindent">With regard to subsistence, there is evidence of adaptation to the Iron Gates environment. Despite Lepenski Vir’s location by the Danube, one of the main corridors of Neolithic expansion in Europe, the site never truly featured a Neolithic, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> food-producing, economy, due to the availability of fish as a perennial source of food and the lack of hinterland for cereal agriculture. Evidence for animal domesticates is similarly limited, found only during the latest phase of occupation at the site (Bökönyi 1970). Individuals with lower <span class="smallcaps2">δ15</span>N values, who resemble farmers isotopically, either grew up elsewhere or acquired crops from farming communities outside the Iron Gates gorge and raised their children as fisherfolk (de Becdelièvre <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020). Hence, for instance, the elevated δ<sup class="calibre8">15</sup>N values observed in Burial 61 (δ<sup class="calibre8">15</sup>N=16.1‰), an Aegean child, genetically male, who interestingly was buried at the rear of House 40, underneath a fish statue known as ‘Sirena’ (Bonsall <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2008).</p>
<p class="indent">The picture is remarkably one-sided. Individuals assigned to the U clade, who presumably descended from Iron Gates hunter-gatherer populations (or at least had hunter-gatherer or admixed mothers), all show elevated δ<sup class="calibre8">15</sup>N isotopic signatures consistent with fishing activities (<a href="13_Chapter07.xhtml#fig7-3">Fig. 7.3</a>). Thus, the onus was on farmers to adopt foraging practices (de Becdelièvre <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020), rather than the opposite. Assimilation of farmers into a foraging community is still a distinct possibility, but the conservativeness of Iron Gates HGs, who showed no inclination to relinquish their mode of subsistence and practices, speaks against a local transition to agriculture. Archaeology’s reliance on indirect proxies, such as burial practices and material culture to determine ‘identity’ (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Chapman 2020), may obscure the more clear-cut economic and demographic processes observed with aDNA and stable isotope data.</p>
<p class="image" id="fig7-3"><img alt="images" src="images/f0085-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 7.3. Distribution of median δ<sup class="calibre10">15</sup>N values for Iron Gates individuals assigned to U and non-U mitochondrial clades. Any δ<sup class="calibre10">15</sup>N value above 10‰ is likely to indicate some intake of aquatic proteins. Individuals from Lepenski Vir carrying a U haplogroup show no major shift to a terrestrial diet. See de Becdelièvre</span> et al. <span class="italic">(2020, fig. 2.5) for a fuller overview of the stable isotopic evidence in relation to mitochondrial haplogroups.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_86"></a>In sum, the case for foragers becoming farmers at Lepenski Vir is thin if not absent. It is not even clear that those descended from Iron Gates HGs lived in the trapezoidal houses or had access to cereal plant-food – the only forager who seemingly changed diet during his lifetime (Burial 7/I-a) remains unsequenced (Bonsall and Boroneanţ 2018, 274).</p>
<p class="h">DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the expansion of the ‘Neolithic’ across continental Europe may seem obvious, we have barely begun to consider how Neolithic communities expanded at a local level. Such an expansion must have entailed setting up new permanent settlements within the territories of established hunter-gatherer groups, and finding ways to manage this encroachment successfully. Not only were the inhabitants of Lepenski Vir joined by a few incomers from the Aegean basin, as reported in the literature (Borić and Price 2013; Borić 2019), but these new people were also relatively numerous from the start of the transitional phase when elaborate trapezoidal houses were constructed (<span class="italic">c</span>. 6200–5900 cal BC).</p>
<p class="indent">We find no evidence of strict patrilocal residence practices at Lepenski Vir, or at least can reject a scenario in which only Neolithic women married into a Mesolithic group. This argument is based on few but significant observations, such as the almost equal representation of males and females with an Aegean background in our samples, as well as the presence of young children (Burial 61), who show no or limited admixture with Iron Gates HGs and must therefore be born to immigrant parents – suggesting relocation of entire Aegean families to the site (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). Some of the genetically identified newcomers were buried inside early trapezoidal houses, which may therefore have been their homes. Iron Gates HGs, on the other hand, appear to have been preferentially buried at the periphery of the village, in the rear upslope area, with limited access to terrestrial food resources, possibly cereals. At present, there is no conclusive evidence of their becoming farmers, and their participation as community members (of the village with houses) remains uncertain. Due caution is needed owing to limited sample size.</p>
<p class="indent">Our results highlight the dangers of relying on type sites such as Lepenski Vir to understand the transition from Mesolithic to Neolithic economies in south-east Europe. If the forager culture appears to be ubiquitous at Lepenski Vir, it was because incoming Aegean farmers adjusted their subsistence to the local environment, and adopted practices and aspects of traditions that were encountered locally. The fact that Iron Gates HGs maintained separate habitation, burial and dietary practices at the site speaks against a local adoption of agriculture. We might speculate that Lepenski Vir served as a staging post or gateway community controlling access through the Iron Gates gorge. Dragoslav Srejović, <a id="page_87"></a>in his original description of the site, imagined Lepenski Vir to have centred around a ‘marketplace’ (Srejović 1974, 366). Latest aDNA and stable isotope results confirm that the site was an important place for cultural and biological interactions right at the outset of agricultural expansion in a frontier region.</p>
<p class="indent">Ancient DNA research cannot provide final ‘answers’ to questions about the past, specifically the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition in the Iron Gates. It uses new techniques and approaches (direct biomarkers of mobility and migration) to approach questions that have traditionally been answered archaeologically. These new techniques may seem invasive and alien, unsettling and intruding on long-standing archaeological interpretations and discussions. However, in our search to understand the past, they offer important new tools and perspectives.</p>
