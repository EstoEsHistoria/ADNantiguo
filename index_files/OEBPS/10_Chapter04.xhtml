<p class="chaptitle">Ancient genomics methodology and genetic insularity in Neolithic Europe</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch4-1"><span class="italic1">Bruno Ariano and Daniel G. Bradley</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">A question for ancient genomics in terms of reproductive networks is whether Neolithic seascapes were accelerants or retardants of genomic exchange. The standard canon of allele frequency-based genome analysis methods has shown conclusively that agriculture was spread via migration rather than acculturation, and throughout the Mediterranean and also across the British and Irish archipelago it is clear that sea corridors carried communities of farmers in initial colonisations. However, for the examination of subsequent networks among genomically similar Neolithic populations a more in-depth interrogation of genomic diversity is needed. This is provided by a next generation of analyses that consider similarity within and between genomes based on shared chunks of chromosomes. The detailed data required for these methods can be obtained by genome-wide imputation in a cost-effective leveraging of partially sequenced genomes. These genealogical approaches parse fine structure among European Neolithic genomes and unveil the retarding effects of seascapes for genetic relations, rather than their connectivities.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">There have been recent informative reviews of ancient DNA methods (Orlando <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021; Liu <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). Here we focus on two aspects: the approaches to enhancing endogenous DNA content to enable sequencing, and genome imputation to enable genealogical approaches to unveiling more detailed affinities among populations and individuals. We discuss our recent analysis of the European Neolithic as an illustration.</p>
<p class="h">METHODS AND PROGRESS IN ANCIENT GENOMICS</p>
<p class="noindent">With ancient specimens, both quantity and quality of retrieved DNA are lessened as a result of age-related lesions, exposure to soil chemistry, microbial challenge and high temperatures. The first decade or so of research on DNA from ancient specimens focused on mitochondrial genomes, which give higher chances of success on extraction but with obviously limited information content. Within its second decade, enabled by the emergence of massively parallelised high-throughput sequencing technologies, the field has decisively shifted to autosomal genome sequencing. However, even with successive technical advances, the cost of sequencing remains a limiting factor and maximising the yield of endogenous DNA is a key aim. This has been enhanced by three main developments: an appreciation of the different DNA preservation capacities of different bone elements; the use of bait <a id="page_42"></a>capture techniques to concentrate targeted sequences; and more aggressive extraction using bleach to selectively remove environmental and contaminating DNA fractions. With choice of bone sample, density is a decisive factor. Gamba <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2014) first showed that the densest bone element, the petrous temporal, gave markedly superior yields to other bones and it has become the sample of choice. Cementum in teeth and dense regions of other bones can also perform well. It has been observed many times that, with well-preserved bones, the early problems of contamination from modern sources that plagued the field have simply been sidestepped by the quantitative analyses allowed by high-throughput data. Contamination persists but usually at such a minor fraction of total yield that essential analyses are unaffected.</p>
<p class="indent">Bait hybridisation capture uses synthesised RNA or DNA strands to bind to endogenous molecules and selectively concentrate them for sequencing (Avila-Arcos <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2011). It is a widely used and cost-effective approach with particular importance for poorly preserved specimens but has two limitations. First, it is most often an incomplete sampling of the genome (compared to more expensive whole genome shotgun sequencing), as the variable positions sequenced are usually pre-defined by the targets chosen. Second, the use of this intermediate selection step can lead to biases when using some platforms, which can affect important population genomic analyses (Rohland <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">Preliminary bleach washing in extractions eliminates selectively the environmental fraction that constitutes the bulk of DNA retrieved from most bones. Sequencing this mixture of bacterial, fungal and other non-target species is a waste of resource. As endogenous DNA is more likely to be effectively embedded in the bone matrix than that of exogenous origin, it is more protected against the destructive action of the bleach (KorleviÄ‡ and Meyer 2019). Including this step often increases several-fold the relative yield of endogenous DNA and makes shotgun sequencing more affordable.</p>
<p class="h">IMPUTATION</p>
<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding notable exceptions where yield and budget allow deep sequencing, researchers usually have to contend with missing genotype information when analysing ancient samples. One approach is to read only one allele from the available aligned positions, that is, consideration of a pseudohaploid genome. However, autosomal genomes are of course diploid and this reduction, in addition to obviously halving the aspirational information within a genome, prevents the use of a range of advanced, informative analyses that use phased variation from all sister chromosomes. However, one increasingly utilised method to fill missing genotype information in ancient genomics is imputation. This takes advantage of linkage between neighbouring loci together with information from a reference panel of genomes to predict unknown genotypes from partial sequence input data (Pasaniuc <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012). Several softwares operate to use known short haplotypes and recombination maps from well-characterised genomes of thousands of individuals to reconstruct the unknown genotype information in target genomes (Browning 2006; LI and Y 2006; Marchini <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2007). However, given the very large number of possible haplotype combinations involved, these methods usually require long computational times <a id="page_43"></a>when imputing millions of diploid variants using hundreds of individuals. One solution is to reduce the number of haplotypes present in the reference dataset by selecting only individuals closer to the target genome. Also and importantly, recent algorithms such as that implemented in the programme GLIMPSE show markedly more efficient computation (Rubinacci <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021).</p>
<p class="indent">Imputation has been successfully applied in ancient humans, first by Gamba and colleagues in 2014 (Gamba <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014) to a time series of Hungarian genomes. Among other findings, this allowed the first demonstration that genetic diversity increased, as indicated by a lower fraction of the genome under runs of homozygosity (ROH) from hunter-gatherers through Neolithic to Bronze and Iron Age samples. Martiniano <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2017) imputed a larger set of ancient samples spanning from the Palaeolithic to the early medieval periods, investigating fine-population structure and phenotypic traits. Antonio <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2019) used the approach to investigate the fine-scale structure of genomes of people that lived in modern-day Italy between the Mesolithic and early modern periods. Thanks to the high resolution provided by the haplotype information the authors of this work could detect a range of ancestries present during the imperial era. More recently Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020), by applying the same methods, discovered that a Neolithic sample from Ireland came from first-order incestuous parentage, suggesting that he may have belonged to an elite dynasty. Imputation also enabled the observation of Irish Mesolithic ancestry within a single Neolithic individual (among 42 sampled), illustrating both the existence and limits of indigenous hunter-gatherer contribution to early farmer ancestry. Diploid imputed genotypes were also effectively used to investigate the expansion of Viking populations from Scandinavia to Europe (Margaryan <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020). Lastly, our recent work expanded the range of samples imputed to also include SNP-captured samples giving in total &gt;300 ancient highly covered diploid genomes (Ariano <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). In this work we investigated population structure, population size and inbreeding for populations ranging from Palaeolithic to Neolithic periods. In particular, by using diploid imputed data for 258 Neolithic individuals, this work highlighted the effects of geography that shaped the genetic architecture of ancient Europe.</p>
<p class="h">HAPLOTYPE-BASED ESTIMATION OF AFFINITY USING A GENEALOGICAL APPROACH</p>
<p class="noindent">When two individuals share a recent common ancestor, chromosome chunks or shared haplotypes, termed â€˜identical by descentâ€™ (IBD), can be observed as having been passed to them through the separating generations (Browning 2008; Browning and Browning 2010). We can consider the affinities between genomes as a compendium of chunk genealogies, giving a rich well of inference. The size and quantity of these IBD segments can be used in genomics to investigate and distinguish affinities at different time-depths stretching from familial kinship (longer stretches of shared genome) to population-level relationship through to separations of thousands of years (resulting in shorter segments). For example, first cousins are approximately 25% IBD, with an average length of segments of 25 centiMorgans (approximately 25 million nucleotide bases) (Thompson 2013). After the detection of IBD segments from dense diploid genotype data other tools can be used to infer kinship or to estimate population size (Manichaikul <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2010; Browning and Browning 2015). For example, Williams and colleagues recently developed a series of tools that help in understanding how IBD segments pattern can be used to infer genealogies (<span class="shyphen"><a href="https://hapi-dna.org">https://hapi-dna.org</a></span>). In another example Belbin and colleagues used IBD to discover a variant associated with short stature that was present in high frequency in Puerto Rican individuals due to a founding population event (Belbin <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2017). The power of analysis of chunk ancestries using the Chromopainter and Finestructure methods were instrumental in the first effective parsing of the diverse ancestries of British people with an immediate ancestry from the island (Lawson <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012; 2015).</p>
<p class="image" id="fig4-1"><a id="page_44"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0044-01.jpg" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 4.1. FineSTRUCTURE (Lawson</span> et al. <span class="italic">2012) analysis estimating clusters of European Neolithic genomes and phylogenetic relationships among them. Based on Chromopainter-calculations of chromosome chunk sharing among individuals, this is adapted from Ariano</span> et al. <span class="italic">(2022) and shows the grouping of samples into geographically and temporally consistent clusters.</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_45"></a>In a recent example of application to ancient genomes, Margaryan <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020) analysed IBD segments among 298 imputed Viking-period genomes to parse their genetic affinities. These included evidence for Danish ancestry in English samples, Swedish influx in the Baltic, and Norwegian dissemination around the Atlantic sphere in Ireland, Iceland and Greenland. More recently, we (Ariano <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022) applied similar methods to 278 ancient Neolithic Europeans to disentangle a genetic structure shaped by barriers and maritime cabotage (<a href="10_Chapter04.xhtml#fig4-1">Fig. 4.1</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">This approach showed that European Neolithic individuals could be sorted into geographically and temporally coherent groups defined on their shared genealogy of segments. At a higher level of branching, the primary division is between east and west Europe, and then between continental populations and those of Britain and Ireland. The latter gives some indication of the influence of sea barriers in forming this structure; differentiation along the Mediterranean is another. Two islands also show some distinction. Maltese Neolithic samples form a small cluster. Interestingly, the only division that emerges within Britain and Ireland is that between a cluster of genomes that predominate in Orkney and those of both mainland islands.</p>
<p class="h">CHUNK GENEALOGY AND DEMOGRAPHY</p>
<p class="noindent">When a population is restricted in size, there is a tendency for enhanced sharing of genome chunks. Simply, within such a group because opportunities for outbreeding in its past were limited, the genealogical loops in shared ancestry tend to be more numerous and more recent. This manifests in data in two ways, increased sharing between individuals in a sample (IBD) and sharing between the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes within an individual manifesting as runs of homozygosity (ROH; <a href="10_Chapter04.xhtml#fig4-2">Fig. 4.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">ROH segments can be used to infer the size of a population and also to investigate inbreeding events that happened in the genealogy of an individual. As for IBD, the quantity and length of the ROH segments are important to understand the relatedness between the parents of an inbred organism. For example, Yengo and colleagues have used the pattern of ROH segments to investigate inbreeding in approximately 450,000 modern individuals in the UK Biobank dataset (Yengo <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019). This showed that approximately 1 out of 3652 individuals of UK origin were from parents who were at least second-degree related. Imputation has allowed the discovery of inbreeding in ancient times. Cassidy <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2020) discovered a high quantity of long ROH segments in a Neolithic Irish individual: the offspring of a union between first-degree relatives.</p>
<p class="image" id="fig4-2"><a id="page_46"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0046-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 4.2. Runs of homozygosity. These are identified as runs of genomic sequence where heterozygosity falls to zero, implying a common ancestry for the male and female parental chromosomes. As inherited chunks of chromosomes are disrupted by recombination through time, long ROH (b) are indicative of recent inbreeding loops, while short ROH (c) are the result of more ancient common ancestries. As such loops are more likely in smaller mating networks, the extent of ROH informs on effective population size.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The presence of short ROH segments informs on population history rather than immediate familial relationships. The levels of ROH have been shown to decline through time from higher levels in Palaeolithic and Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, through Neolithic and Bronze Age populations in Europe. This was noted in the first imputed data set (Gamba <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2014), then more markedly by Jones <span class="italic">et al.</span> (2015) with publication of Upper Palaeolithic Europeans. Both Irish and Japanese ancient hunter-gatherers show enhanced ROH profiles, presumably because of demographic effects in either their colonisation of those islands or subsequently restricted population sizes (Cassidy <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020; Cooke <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021).</p>
<p class="indent">Recently, developing a novel approach, Ringbauer <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2021) detected stretches of homozygous genomes in ancient human genomes without requiring an imputation step. This allowed the authors to investigate inbreeding in 1785 ancient humans, comprehensively describing the decline of ROH (and consequently increase in effective population size) with time across multiple regions, with the highest drop reported in the transition between Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. <a href="10_Chapter04.xhtml#fig4-3">Figure 4.3</a> shows ROH calculated for ancient European genomes using our imputation pipeline. It illustrates the broad trend. Ancient hunter-gatherers have higher proportions of their genomes where parental genomes shared identical chunks. However, this only rarely manifests as an outlying large ROH burden from a degree of recent familial inbreeding; the highest ROH observed are in several Neolithic samples. The inbreeding loops in European hunter-gatherers are the result of deeper coalescences denoting a limited overall reproductive population network size, but not one where consanguineous union was the norm.</p>
<p class="image" id="fig4-3"><a id="page_47"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0047-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 4.3. Fraction of European genomes under runs of homozygosity (FROH) in different periods. Hunter-gatherer (HG) individuals have a distribution of higher FROH, and this declines through time, consistent with higher effective population size. Each period has outliers, notably the Neolithic where several individuals with consanguineous ancestry have been identified.</span></p>
<p class="indent">Recently, we discovered the second most inbred prehistoric genome yet reported, a Neolithic Maltese who was likely the result of a union of second-degree relatives (<a href="10_Chapter04.xhtml#fig4-3">Fig. 4.3</a>: MLT9) (Ariano <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021). This individual was one of three genomes recovered from the XagÄ§ra Circle hypogeum where the other two (<a href="10_Chapter04.xhtml#fig4-3">Fig. 4.3</a>: MLT5, MLT6) also showed high levels of ROH. However, these latter involved shorter shared chunks, at a level more reminiscent of earlier European hunter-gatherers, and indicated a restricted ancestral mating network rather than more immediate inbreeding. Both IBD (Browning and Browning 2015) and ROH (Fernandes <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2021) may be used to estimate effective population size and for the three Maltese individuals we estimated this to be small at 400â€“600. This matches (within a couple of multiples) the estimated carrying capacity of <a id="page_48"></a>Neolithic Gozo (French <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020, 258) but more importantly indicates they are drawn from a population without substantial external influx within their recent ancestry. This was a striking illustration of genomic insularity and is mirrored in other data. The second most restricted population signal in the Neolithic sample came from remains in the Tomb of the Eagles at Isbister in Orkney. This is perhaps surprising given the cultural flourishing of Orkney and undoubted long-range contacts in this period (Edmonds 2019). However, population restriction is echoed in a later Orcadian Bronze Age signal (at Links of Noltland) which estimated an effective population size of only a few hundred (Dulias <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). Ringbauer <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2021) have also noted a coincidence of high ROH levels and island contexts.</p>
<p class="h">WERE NEOLITHIC SEAWAYS HIGHWAYS?</p>
<p class="noindent">An important archaeological question is whether the seascapes of prehistory need be regarded as barriers or rather, as evidenced for example by the rapid westward spread of agricultural lifeways along the Mediterranean littoral and also myriad material culture networks, should be more correctly seen as corridors facilitating exchange (Rainbird 2007; Cherry and Leppard 2014). Despite obvious difficulties in maritime transportation, domestic animals appear in Cyprus <span class="italic">c.</span> 10,600 years ago (Vigne <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2012), only very shortly after their initial capture for management on the Near Eastern mainland.</p>
<p class="indent">A consequent question for ancient genomics in terms of reproductive networks is whether Neolithic seascapes were accelerants or retardants of genomic exchange. The parsing of fine structure among European Neolithic genomes unveils some effects of seascapes in shaping the ancient genetic geography of the continent. Some island communities (Malta, Orkney, Gotland) show elevated levels of ROH or within-site IBD, suggesting that their mating networks were limited, probably influenced by their maritime environment. They also show reduced levels of imported ancestral admixtures relative to the mainland. Both Malta and Sardinia have been shown to have persisting balances of Neolithic and European hunter-gatherer ancestry despite the dissemination of a resurgence in western hunter-gatherer ancestry experienced across mainland Europe (Fernandes <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Marcus <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Ariano <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022). The Bronze Age genomic turnover in Orkney differs dramatically from that of mainland Britain with a persistence of local Y-chromosome haplotypes (Fernandes <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Marcus <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2020; Dulias <span class="italic">et al.</span> 2022).</p>
<p class="indent">The power of haplotype-based analysis, parsing relatedness within and between genomes considering contiguous chunks of sequence, has allowed striking illustrations of genomic insularity in the European Neolithic.</p>
