<p class="chaptitle">A glance at early Neolithic south-east and central Europe – as reflected by archaeological and archaeogenetic data</p>
<p class="chapaut" id="ch8-1"><span class="italic1">Eszter Bánffy</span></p>
<p class="noindenth"><span class="italic">Focusing on Early Neolithic continental Europe, I present new archaeological results in comparison to similarly recent ancient DNA and stable isotope studies. I address various scenarios from one region in the Balkans and another in northern Germany, before zooming in on the eastern and western parts of the Carpathian basin: the last region with direct Balkan migrant groups and the first region with a growing local contribution as well as genetic influx. These examples show that there are possibilities to reconcile aDNA data with the archaeological record, as well as some contradictions, but above all they highlight the extremely high diversity of the Neolithic transition.</span></p>
<p class="h">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="noindent">I am going to attempt to give a brief sketch for the continental European Neolithic of how archaeological and archaeogenetic data relate to each other. I choose to focus on the beginnings: the Neolithic transition and the first few centuries of food-productive, sedentary life. With the examples selected, I aim to show that neither the thesis of a ‘wave of advance’ (Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1984) nor a clear-cut dichotomy (as suggested by many authors) between hunter-gatherer and farmer existence can be supported.</p>
<p class="indent">As has become clear, the ‘DNA revolution’ and sister methods within molecular bioarchaeology are pivotal in the history of archaeology, brilliant tools that give us formerly unthinkable aspects to study, and indeed insights of which Neolithic population groups themselves may have not been aware at all. Their genetic ancestry alone would not have basically influenced their personhood and group identity. Yet genomic composition, Sr, N or O isotope results or oral microbiomes could have – sometimes more directly, sometimes in quite a hidden way – an influence on the cultural and social character of communities. Shared ancestry might go with similar subsistence strategies, leading for example to similar oral microbiomes or cultural traits. These chosen identities might, over time, also lead to marriage ties within a given group. Thus, the picture from such data and analyses needs to be compared with archaeological evidence for material culture, landscape choice, settlement pattern and importantly, contact and exchange networks; networks are especially important to compare with bioarchaeological patterns.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_92"></a>It is now a fact that periods like the Neolithic transition and the early Neolithic are firmly bound up with migration. Yet there is a major <span class="italic">caveat.</span> While comparing archaeological and aDNA data, it is important to do so without falling into the trap of previous cultural-historical migration theories. Neolithic archaeological and bioarchaeological patterns were arguably fluid, constantly shaping and re-shaping; this perspective is the main difference between 21st-century trajectories and earlier, static, migrationist theories (Furholt 2017; Frieman and Hofmann 2019).</p>
<p class="indent">First, we need to note the importance of terms such as ‘the Neolithic transition’ or ‘the Neolithic lifestyle’. The advent of the Neolithic in Europe, as elsewhere globally, marked a profound transformation in human history, a major historical turn with many facets, but all with similar outcomes: a sedentary and food-producing Europe. Research on the archaeology of the European Neolithic transition is still rather split; it either consists of individual case studies (a bottom-up approach) or tries to find a generalising explanation for the whole historical process, assuming a fairly uniform transformation. Bioarchaeological data, if used cautiously, have the potential to cause a step-change here.</p>
<p class="indent">Most probably, for a range of different reasons, domestication of cereals and animals began at several distinct spots in between the Levant and the Zagros, in the 11th–9th millennia cal BC. The food-producing lifestyle spread soon towards Anatolia. To the best of our present knowledge, the process of Neolithisation was neither an ‘invention’, nor a single ‘innovation’, but rather a slowly emerging phenomenon moulded by the consequences (or side-effects) of meaningful choices of social practices, experimenting with domestication and the impact of all these in the cognitive sphere of communities. The pace of changes accelerated towards the last centuries of the transition (Watkins 2018). People’s choices must have been influenced by climate change and demographic booms and busts, and motivated by risk-taking and exploiting opportunities, as well as perhaps the desire for higher prestige and other ideologies. (Better said, the process probably involved a combination of these elements.) Due to the sometimes patchy, mosaic-like and often highly diverse local variants of the transition, only a few common, ubiquitous traits of Neolithisation can be identified. Yet, ultimately, the changes proved to be irreversible (Robb 2013).</p>
<p class="indent">Outside of the primary, Near Eastern area, the Neolithisation process was also dependent on two factors: migrants arriving, and the choices of local foragers to adapt or refuse (or a blend of these). While it has long been clear that farming as a system was brought to Europe from outside, a dichotomy of migration versus adaptation has accompanied research on the Neolithic transition. Studying different find types also causes divergent views on the migration-adaptation dichotomy; arguments for migration in the culture-historical tradition were mainly based on pottery-making that spread from the south-east – while lithic experts were advocates of autochthonous development, due to local sources and continuing flint-knapping traditions. Evidence for population growth immediately following the introduction of the Neolithic into the Balkans also suggests migration (Bocquet-Appel <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2012). In the beginning, the ‘revolutionary’ molecular biological analyses put the Neolithic transition in the spotlight; now, a series of new results, coming from novel methods, need to be reconciled with the aforementioned traditional archaeological evidence.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_93"></a>I shall start with a case study from south-east Europe, from the Balkan-Danubian route of the spread of farming, which has a scant Mesolithic presence. My next case study is the Polish and German Plain, with a belated and longer-lasting turn and masses of surviving and flourishing forager communities. Then, I shall focus on the Carpathian basin, the region which seems to be the decisive zone where the ratio of migrants from the Balkans and cooperating local foragers turned. The new formation born here, the Linear Pottery culture (LBK), spread rapidly to large parts of continental Europe in the second half of the 6th millennium cal BC. The LBK helped to define the 5th millennium and had a strong impact until the advent of the 4th millennium; thus, there are ties with the first farming groups arriving in south-east Britain around that time. I shall try to highlight various processes that made the Neolithic lifestyle irreversible in the end, but above all, I would like to give some thoughts about people, encounters and mobility.</p>
<p class="indent">Farming was first introduced to south-east Europe in the mid-7th millennium cal BC and was associated with migrants arriving ultimately from Anatolia. Mathieson <span class="italic">et al</span>. (2018) have shown that the first farmers dispersed with limited hunter-gatherer admixture, yet some of their early groups were exceptions. This patchy, sporadic genetic mixture in the Balkans becomes more and more frequent and intensive, going northwards.</p>
<p class="h">THE BALKANS</p>
<p class="noindent">My first case study involves regions where the sporadic Mesolithic presence can surely not be ascribed to gaps in research (<a href="14_Chapter08.xhtml#fig8-1">Fig. 8.1</a>). It seems that there may have been some ‘niches’ with more concentrated settlement; apart from the Aegean, there are concentrations in the Trieste karstic regions with many caves, a similar landscape in Montenegro, and certainly, the most researched and well-known region, the Danube Gorges along both its Serbian and Romanian banks. There seems to be a sparsely occupied region in the central Balkans that became one of the centres of the first farmers upon their arrival.</p>
<p class="indent">From all these settlement concentrations, recent genetic and stable isotope analyses surprisingly show that the difference between the stereotypes of mobile hunters and foragers versus sedentary farmers in fact becomes blurred. Taking landscape use and archaeological remains, strontium isotope analyses for the mobility of humans and domesticated animals together, they all speak for more sedentary hunter-gatherers and more mobile first farmers than previously acknowledged (Borić and Price 2013; Price 2021).</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence from the Vrbička cave and at Crvena Stijena (Borić <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021) and also from the lowland Kula site (Živaljević <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017; 2021) shows that diachronic changes in food resource exploitation were determined by the character of the landscape and soil offering food resources, rather than the nature of the site being ‘Mesolithic’ or ‘Neolithic’. That is, Kula lies in an open landscape that proved to be more suitable for animal husbandry and it continued to be in use also, most likely due to its long-term importance, as a fishing spot in the Early Neolithic. Similarly, at Danube Gorges sites, the diet remains largely based on the consumption of aquatic resources both before and after the Mesolithic–Neolithic transition. This was probably a result of favourable environmental conditions for such resources, but also of dietary practices inherited from earlier Mesolithic communities. A recent study shows that the incomer farmer ancestry became dominant over the native Mesolithic ancestry by the early 6th millennium cal BC (Brami <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022).</p>
<p class="image" id="fig8-1"><a id="page_94"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0094-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 8.1. The main sites mentioned in the text (source: author and RGK: Oliver Wagner).</span></p>
<p class="indent">From food perspectives, it seems that ecological conditions, local traditions and economic innovations interacted in various ways to shape the complex and multi-faceted Neolithisation process. DNA found in archaeological dental calculus proves that the introduction of farming in southern Europe did not significantly alter the oral microbiomes of local forager groups; thus, the basic food sources may not have undergone major changes (Ottoni <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2021). The macrobotanical analysis came to a similar conclusion. It appears that more or less the same ‘set’ of taxa were consistently in use through the Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic, suggesting an unchanged availability of the (local) resources, as well as continuity of the ‘gathering aspect’ of subsistence strategy over a period of more than a thousand years (Marinova <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2013).</p>
<p class="indent">In the central Balkans, the next small insight is a genuine migrant farmers’ settlement, along the river Morava. In the extended, classical and late Starčevo site of Svinjarička Čuka, <a id="page_95"></a>the remains of buildings with upright walls were found. The site is rich in pottery, lithics and other finds, and yet it cannot be stated that its people were fully sedentary (Horejs <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019). While all kinds of cereals and domesticated animals were attested, larger amounts of wild-gathered plants and bones of hunted game were also present. The recent scrutiny of comparative and multidisciplinary analyses should shed light on stages of ‘becoming sedentary’, at around 5600 cal BC.</p>
<p class="indent">Approaching the northern frontiers of the Balkans, a stark wave of intruding early farmers into the Carpathian basin and introducing the full Neolithic would be expected. Yet Körös sites in the Serbian Banat like Bucova Puszta show a different picture. Here rather we find nutrition strategies adapted to the riverine environment: an overwhelmingly ‘Mesolithic’ aquatic diet, at least as based on the remains of a child from the late Körös phase (<span class="italic">c</span>. 5600 cal BC). Were the inhabitants adaptable hunter-gatherers keeping some domesticates but basically sticking with their old traditions? Based on the full Körös context, they might rather be first farmers adapting to local circumstances (Krauß <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2018).</p>
<p class="h">THE NORTH GERMAN PLAIN</p>
<p class="noindent">A brief look at the other side of continental Europe offers a different picture. The transition not only takes place almost two millennia later, but the further north we look, the more visible the local foragers’ participation becomes. In the north, skeletons even amidst Neolithic contexts are often genetically heterogeneous, having both Neolithic and local forager ancestry. Such sites are often to be found in the late 5th and early 4th millennium cal BC, in the Michelsberg environment in the west and in the latest Ertebølle and early Funnel Beaker orbits in the east, in the northern lowlands.</p>
<p class="indent">The Funnel Beaker groups evolved out of coastal fishing communities at the time when the various regional post-LBK groups declined. We can rather speak about taking over specific elements of the Neolithic within still foraging economies. In the genetic mixture there are no leading rules, and the patterns show extremely strong regional variations (Bramanti <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2009).</p>
<p class="indent">At several sites between the end of the LBK period and the intensive phases of the later full Neolithic, exchange relations between farmers and foragers become detectable, and also, the regional continuity of hunter-gatherer subsistence as far as the advent of the Bronze Age. It remains still open, to what extent ‘encapsulated’ hunter-gatherer groups or central and western Neolithic groups with already mixed Anatolian and hunter-gatherer ancestry are most typical (Allentoft <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022; Cummings <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022, 5). However, the northern coastland of Germany is marked by long-lasting settlements of late Mesolithic peoples. The long-lasting exchange between Mesolithic processes and approaches by their southern neighbours, the farming groups, seems to involve tools and food, and probably also innovation, new technologies and information, resulting in a high-level amalgamation. An example for the long separation of groups living next to each other is the cemetery at Ostorf, on a small lake island near the Baltic Sea, with some excellently preserved burials. Many of the graves include hunter-gatherer-fisher grave goods, such as arrow points, fishing hooks and animal tooth pendants, reflecting a hunter-gatherer-fisher population <a id="page_96"></a>during the Funnel Beaker (TRB) period. Their diet was determined by freshwater food (Lübke <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2009).</p>
<p class="indent">The parallel existence of earliest TRB and Ertebølle becomes also apparent at the cemetery of Groß Fredenwalde on the north-eastern edge of Germany (Terberger <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015). After a short-lived early LBK site nearby, there is a long standstill for almost a millennium, with a survival of the mosaic-like tradition of different dietary pathways (4300–4200 cal BC). After 4000 cal BC, along with exclusively agricultural life, the Baltic coastal groups still show an elevated fish consumption (Kotula <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020).</p>
<p class="indent">In the north German plain, thus, the fading cultural and biological impact from the south combined with the strong and long-lasting fisher and forager lifestyle appear to determine the long-lasting turn to the Neolithic, until the 4th millennium (and even longer further north and east). These pivotal differences in time, tempo and participants between the Balkans and northern central Europe point to the region where the process possibly may have turned.</p>
<p class="h">THE CARPATHIAN BASIN</p>
<p class="noindent">The third region to zoom in on will be a closer look at late foragers and first farmers in the Carpathian basin: the last region with direct Balkan migrant groups (this connects it with south-east Europe), and the first region with a growing local contribution as well as genetic influx (which grows further towards the north).</p>
<p class="indent">The basin is divided into two major zones, both geological and climatic (the so-called central European Balkan agro-ecological barrier), with a warmer and drier southern, and a more Atlantic north-western climate. This ‘barrier’ is, meanwhile, a contact zone, creating a longer-term permeable frontier between groups in both regions (Bánffy and Sümegi 2012). So, what we see in the early 6th millennium cal BC is a far from simple scenario (<a href="14_Chapter08.xhtml#fig8-2">Fig. 8.2</a>); the closer one looks, the more patchy the ‘wave of advance’ increasingly becomes.</p>
<p class="indent">The map for the first half of the 6th millennium cal BC (<a href="14_Chapter08.xhtml#fig8-3">Fig. 8.3</a>) shows why the south-west part of the Carpathian basin is a key area. The newcomers’ spread splits into two main branches in the frontier zone: in the east and central basin called Körös culture (or, in Romanian, Criş), and in the west, in Transdanubia, the periphery of the Starčevo culture. While the Körös branch developed locally in the following centuries, the zone in mid-Transdanubia played a crucial role in the formation of the LBK and thus for the first farmers of extended areas across Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next phase (<a href="14_Chapter08.xhtml#fig8-4">Fig. 8.4</a>), a new cultural unit, the LBK, was born in the northern Starčevo margins. Archaeologically, the Starčevo input is clear, but the presence of the Mesolithic groups long remained an open question, only recently starting to be filled with data. Thus, there is still scanty but increasing evidence for Mesolithic habitation (Duffy <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2022). In the eastern lowland, the Alföld or Great Hungarian Plain, a Mesolithic niche with many sites has been found. A systematic survey near old oxbow channels detected several sites yielding characteristic geometric microlithic scatters. Four of these sites have been excavated (Kertész 1996; Bánffy <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2007). At Jásztelek, a round hut was found with an entrance at the southern side. Based on lithics, the site must be late Mesolithic, so the foragers here might have lived during the onset of the 6th millennium. This was the time when the first farmers were spreading northwards in the Great Hungarian Plain. Previously, it would have hardly occurred to researchers that these migrants may have had any contact with (rather invisible) late foragers. But the settlement deposit from Váncsod in the northern Körös region, found quite recently, sheds light on two things (Szeverényi and Priskin 2020). First, the inhabitants must have received the information about Tokaj obsidian, far away north from their outreach area, probably from those who had access and control over the obsidian sources in the wooded mountains. Secondly, the Körös groups were used to the Banat flint and other local flint sources in their area of origin. Their interest now turned to the north, towards new possibilities. This eagerness for novel knowledge and networks can be seen as a triggering effect for the Neolithisation process.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 8.3. Early Neolithic cultural formations in the Carpathian basin: first half of the 6th millennium cal BC (source: author).</span></p>
<p class="indent">The ambition of reaching out further northwards continues after the Körös period. While in its early phase, with settlements exclusively on flat loess landscapes, the early LBK was rather unified in all its habits and materiality, later on many local groups formed, like Tiszadob, Bükk and Szilmeg. These groups occupy the mountains that the LBK people had earlier avoided (Csengeri 2014). The known sites increase and material culture including pottery starts to show foreign features. These are facts long known, but now the question becomes timely, whether it was local forager interactions that could make such an imprint on their place in the landscape and their material finds.</p>
<p class="indent">Some years ago, our dataset was significantly extended by the results of a large German-Hungarian project (led by Kurt Alt and the author), with more than 700 skeletons sampled, from the 6th to the 5th millennia cal BC. Thus, the archaeological data could be amplified with the results of both mitochondrial aDNA analyses (Szécsényi-Nagy <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2015; forthcoming) and autosomal results (Lipson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017). The results show a gradual increase in hunter-gatherer ancestry over time, although these never reach the levels seen, for example, in Middle Neolithic populations in Germany or Iberia. Further, in all three regions we can detect that incidental admixture between farmers and foragers began shortly after initial contact; the sparse Mesolithic population may have a role in the low rate. More intensive hunter-gatherer presence – along the main Balkan route – can only be detected in the Danube Gorges area (<a href="14_Chapter08.xhtml#fig8-5">Fig. 8.5</a>), and it is also clear that hunter-gatherer ancestry in Neolithic populations increased for at least a thousand years.</p>
<p class="image" id="fig8-4"><a id="page_99"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0099-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 8.4. Cultural transformations at the transition to the middle Neolithic in the mid-6th millennium cal BC in the Carpathian basin (source: author).</span></p>
<p class="indent">The Alföld Körös and LBK groups of the 6th millennium cal BC never expanded beyond the Great Hungarian Plain, differentiating into regional groups instead. Regarding the western part of the Carpathian basin, combined data from sites and off-site coring as well as re-evaluations of old finds preceded the first thorough and planned excavation of a Transdanubian Mesolithic settlement. After having identified a one-time lake that eventually dried but with fishing tools including bone harpoons proving a Mesolithic presence, a large project began in an intensive niche. At one of the settlements, Regöly, a round hut, similar to the one in Jásztelek, was brought to light (Eichmann <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2010). Postholes were cut into its edge; in the case of the deeper ones, even the inclination angle could be measured. This feature can most certainly be identified as a domestic building.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly to the access to obsidian in the Alföld, here the red radiolarite from Szentgál in the Balaton upland proved to be the main target of exchange. Mesolithic and early Neolithic Starčevo, and subsequently LBK communities, used flints from this source almost exclusively. No matter the lower quality of radiolarite as compared to obsidian, this raw material, as well as completed forms, signalled late Mesolithic contacts between the Carpathian basin and southern Czechia (Mateiciucová 2008), and accompanied the entire distribution of the LBK groups along the Danube basin and further to the north and west. In western Germany, such Szentgál radiolarite flints have been found with the first farming groups arriving there (Zimmermann 1995).</p>
<p class="image" id="fig8-5"><a id="page_100"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0100-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 8.5. Comparison between the main Balkan route and the Danube Gorges, including data from Mathieson</span> et al. <span class="italic">2018 (source: Szécsényi-Nagy</span> et al. <span class="italic">forthcoming, fig. 19).</span></p>
<p class="indent">According to our current data, there must have been an overlapping period between the end of the late Mesolithic and the start of early farming settlement in Transdanubia. This must have been the case in between the many sites found near each other in between the Regöly Mesolithic settlement and the large, first phase of the Alsónyék mega-site. The time of the Starčevo occupation there was precisely dated (Oross <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2016) but late datable forager skeletons are still lacking. Yet strong indications for coexistence and exchange are provided by the presence of Szentgál flints (controlled by foragers) in Starčevo contexts. The Starčevo genetic ancestry shows the so-called mitochondrial Neolithic package, with minimal local signals (Lipson <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2017; Szécsényi-Nagy <span class="italic">et al</span>. forthcoming).</p>
<p class="indent">The missing link between Starčevo farmers and locals, who both contributed to the birth of the first central European farming communities, the LBK in the Balaton region and westwards, has been found and excavated in a region that is mostly suitable for fishing and to a limited extent for agriculture. A sudden rise in the water level in the early 6th millennium cal BC may have inundated Mesolithic lakeshore settlements (<a href="14_Chapter08.xhtml#fig8-6">Fig. 8.6</a>), but the Formative LBK sites are located exactly at the edges of the one-time lacustrine areas. The earliest LBK sites thus reflect a clear Mesolithic settlement pattern.</p>
<p class="image" id="fig8-6"><a id="page_101"></a><img alt="images" src="images/f0101-01.jpg" class="calibre1"/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="italic">Figure 8.6. Formative LBK sites along one-time lakeshore areas in the Balaton region (source: author).</span></p>
<p class="indent">The only fully excavated Formative site to date is Szentgyörgyvölgy-Pityerdomb (Bánffy 2004). The two timber and wattle-and-daub longhouses – as shown elsewhere – may have been invented by late Starčevo communities and were thus brought with the first farmers to the Balaton region (Bánffy and Höhler-Brockmann 2020). The rich assemblages of chipped stone come exclusively from Szentgál, some 200 km away from Pityerdomb and controlled by local foragers. The pottery, constituted by some 14,000 sherds, are of real Starčevo character, yet with many signs speaking for LBK features, including incised linear decorations (Bánffy and Whittle 2022). The new identity shows traces of an amalgamation and joint innovation. The Formative LBK (that is, perhaps the first four to five generations) must have been piecemeal sedentary and based on farming adapted to the wetland. Thus, the input of the local foragers in the settlement pattern, and the subsistence strategies in a non-loess soil context, become visible and traceable.</p>
<p class="indent">Intensive contacts including sharing goods and knowledge are often traceable in the material record (Benz 2010, 10), as is the case in Transdanubia. Yet the barely existing <a id="page_102"></a>local Mesolithic DNA lineages raise the question about the nature of such contacts. Did foragers and farmers network without interbreeding – either by rule or on a voluntary basis? There are examples for separation between neighbouring farming and forager communities, either by mutual disdain of the other lifeways, or through concerns (Nicolaisen 1976). We can also presume that the idea of kinship worked in a special way, such as a combination of primarily social and then increasing biological relatedness. In later generations and in northerly regions the higher scale of local ancestry is apparent; in the LBK populations of the 54th–52nd centuries the Mesolithic U2 and U5a haplotypes reach 15% in north-east Hungary and in northern Transdanubia (Szécsényi-Nagy <span class="italic">et al</span>. forthcoming, fig. 22).</p>
<p class="indent">The higher ratio of mobility in the western, Transdanubian part of the Carpathian basin is also traceable on the basis on Sr isotope analyses (Depaermentier <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2020; forthcoming). Whilst the first farmers were clearly mobile in the entire Carpathian basin, the early LBK groups only moved from Transdanubia towards modern Austria, southern Czechia and Germany.</p>
<p class="indent">To summarise the genetic picture of the Neolithisation process and subsequent centuries, the contrast between locals and the newly arrived farming groups is sharp. Yet, from the beginnings, the small signs of admixture of immigrants with local groups were detectable in the mtDNA haplogroup diversity, which shortly started to rise. There seems to be a delay of some 120 years to reach more than 10% of the local forager proportion in the genetic data. In the Carpathian basin, thus, it seems that the exchange and social contact network preceded interbreeding, but only for a few generations. This growing local signal fits well with the archaeological diversity of later LBK groups.</p>
<p class="h">OUTLOOK</p>
<p class="noindent">My last focus will follow the first farming groups along the Danube valley. The early phase of the settlement Brunn 2 in eastern Austria, defined by longhouses and Formative LBK pottery, closely resembles Pityerdomb in Transdanubia. Recently, some aspects of the site have been processed and published (Stadler and Kotova 2019), along with a genetic investigation of the earliest skeletons (Nikitin <span class="italic">et al</span>. 2019). This latter result can also be called an eye-opener, to understand the increasing local genetic input north and westwards of the ‘central European Balkan agro-ecological barrier’, a phenomenon of growing U haplogroups in the ancestry similar to the situation in neighbouring northern Transdanubia, mentioned above. In Brunn 2, the mixed ancestry between West European hunter-gatherers becomes apparent. Two of the individuals had a mixture of forager-related and Balkan farming-related ancestry, one of them with approximately 50% of each, while the third individual had Neolithic migrant ancestry. Strontium isotope analysis revealed that the individual of roughly half and half forager and farmer descent was non-local to the area. Overall, our data indicate interbreeding between farmers whose ancestors ultimately came from western Anatolia and local foragers. These contacts started within the first few generations after the farmers’ arrival, and highlight the integrative nature and mixed composition of the early LBK communities.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the settlement of Vedrovice (in the south of the Czech Republic) was founded by a small community of incomers who probably originated in western Hungary towards <a id="page_103"></a>the end of the Formative phase of the LBK in the 55th century cal BC. Most settlement burials were of immigrant people. Links with western Hungary are evident in the material culture, notably among the ceramic elements, and in the presence of Transdanubian Szentgál radiolarite. Apparently, soon after the settlement was founded, it attracted people from hunting-gathering communities within the region and outside it (Zvelebil and Pettitt 2013). The two groups mingled. The later establishment of the cemetery makes locally born individuals rise to dominance, which resulted in new practices, such as establishing a burial place outside of the settlement.</p>
<p class="h">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">Among many stories, this chapter has shed light on three different ways to the Neolithic transition in continental Europe. I have tried to involve both archaeological and bioarchaeological data; their comparison resulted both in cases of some contradiction and cases where the two kinds of results chime together. Following the time of the transition and the later Neolithic centuries, cultural, economic and genetic contacts happened first probably among locals, then between locals and newcomers. This is a many-coloured garland of unfolding stories, encounters, adaptations and human choices; each of the niches seems different. All reflect on a somewhat hidden aspect of the beginnings of sedentary life that involves one-time living people with personal decisions, contacts and perhaps even networking with neighbouring groups, all played out at the local level.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I would like to stress that only successful transition processes are detectable for archaeologists and bioarchaeologists, while probably countless experiments that ended in cul-de-sacs were undertaken. Failed attempts, however, are also meaningful, because they are part of the Neolithic transition, and even more so, because we could learn so much from failures when thinking in sustainable lifeways in current times and for the future.</p>
